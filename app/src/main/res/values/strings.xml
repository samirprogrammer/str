        <item> <![CDATA[
       Once upon a time, a <b>monkey</b> lived in a <b>Jamun tree</b> by a <b>river</b>. He was alone—without friends or family—but he was <b>happy and content</b>. The <b>Jamun tree</b> provided him with plenty of <b>sweet fruit</b> to eat, <b>shade</b> from the sun, and <b>shelter</b> from the rain. <br/><br/>

One day, a <b>crocodile</b> swam up the <b>river</b> and climbed onto the <b>riverbank</b> to rest under the <b>monkey\'s tree</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>"Hello!"</b> called the friendly <b>monkey</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>"Hello,"</b> replied the <b>crocodile</b>, surprised. <b>"Do you know where I can find some food? I haven\'t eaten all day—there don\'t seem to be any fish left in the river."</b> <br/><br/>

The <b>monkey</b>, who didn\'t eat <b>fish</b>, said, <b>"I wouldn\'t know about that, but I have plenty of ripe, juicy jamuns in my tree. Would you like to try some?"</b> He plucked a few <b>fruits</b> and tossed them down to the <b>crocodile</b>. <br/><br/>

The hungry <b>crocodile</b> ate them all, even though <b>crocodiles</b> don\'t usually eat <b>fruit</b>. He loved their <b>sweet, tangy taste</b> and, feeling a bit shy, asked if he could have some more. <br/><br/>

<b>"Of course!"</b> the <b>monkey</b> replied generously, throwing down more <b>fruit</b>. <b>"Come back whenever you feel like having more!"</b> <br/><br/>

From that day on, the <b>crocodile</b> visited the <b>monkey</b> daily. They became <b>good friends</b>—chatting, telling <b>stories</b>, and enjoying the delicious <b>jamuns</b> together. The <b>monkey</b> would always share as much <b>fruit</b> as the <b>crocodile</b> wanted. <br/><br/>

One day, the <b>crocodile</b> mentioned his <b>wife and family</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>"Why didn\'t you tell me earlier that you had a wife?"</b> asked the <b>monkey</b>. <b>"Please take some jamuns home for her today!"</b> <br/><br/>

The <b>crocodile</b> gratefully took the <b>fruit</b> to his <b>wife</b>. She had never tasted anything so <b>sweet</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>"Imagine,"</b> she said, <b>"how delicious the creature who eats these jamuns every day must be! The monkey has eaten these his whole life—his flesh must be even sweeter than the fruit."</b> <br/><br/>

She insisted that her <b>husband</b> invite the <b>monkey</b> for a <b>meal</b>. <b>"Then we can eat him,"</b> she added gleefully. <br/><br/>

The <b>crocodile</b> was <b>horrified</b>. How could he <b>eat his friend</b>? He tried to explain that he couldn\'t possibly harm the <b>monkey</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>"He is my only true friend,"</b> he protested. <br/><br/>

But his <b>wife</b> refused to listen. <b>"Since when do crocodiles eat fruit and spare animals?"</b> she demanded. <br/><br/>

When the <b>crocodile</b> still refused, she pretended to fall <b>gravely ill</b>. <b>"Only a monkey\'s heart can cure me,"</b> she wailed. <b>"If you love me, you will bring me your friend\'s heart!"</b> <br/><br/>

The <b>poor crocodile</b> was <b>torn</b>. He didn\'t want to <b>betray his friend</b>, but he also couldn\'t let his <b>wife die</b>. At last, he gave in and decided to bring the <b>monkey</b> home. <br/><br/>

<b>"O dear friend,"</b> he called as he reached the <b>Jamun tree</b>. <b>"My wife insists that you come to our home for a meal. She is grateful for all the fruit you\'ve sent her and has asked me to bring you as our honored guest."</b> <br/><br/>

The <b>monkey</b> felt <b>flattered</b> but hesitated. <b>"I\'d love to come, but I don\'t know how to swim."</b> <br/><br/>

<b>"Don\'t worry about that,"</b> said the <b>crocodile</b>. <b>"I\'ll carry you on my back!"</b> <br/><br/>

Trusting his <b>friend</b>, the <b>monkey</b> eagerly jumped onto the <b>crocodile\'s back</b>. The <b>crocodile</b> swam into the <b>deep, wide river</b>. When they were <b>far from the shore</b>, he finally revealed the <b>truth</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>"My wife is very ill,"</b> he said. <b>"The only thing that can cure her is a monkey\'s heart. So, dear friend, this will be the end of you—and our friendship."</b> <br/><br/>

The <b>monkey</b> was <b>horrified</b> but didn\'t panic. Thinking <b>quickly</b>, he said, <b>"Dear friend, I am so sorry to hear about your wife\'s illness. I\'d be happy to help her, but I left my heart back in the Jamun tree! If you take me back, I can fetch it for her."</b> <br/><br/>

The <b>foolish crocodile</b> <b>believed him</b> and quickly turned around, swimming back to the <b>tree</b>. As soon as they reached the <b>shore</b>, the <b>monkey</b> leaped off the <b>crocodile\'s back</b> and climbed to <b>safety</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>"You foolish and false friend!"</b> he called from the <b>treetop</b>. <b>"Don\'t you know that we carry our hearts within us? I will never trust you again, nor will I ever share my fruit with you. Go away and never return!"</b> <br/><br/>

The <b>crocodile</b> felt <b>ashamed and foolish</b>—he had lost both a <b>dear friend</b> and his <b>supply of sweet jamuns</b>. Meanwhile, the <b>clever monkey</b> had saved himself through <b>quick thinking</b>. <br/><br/>

From that day on, the <b>monkey</b> and the <b>crocodile</b> never met again. The <b>crocodile</b> realized that a <b>crocodile and a monkey</b> could never be <b>true friends</b>—after all, <b>crocodiles preferred to eat monkeys rather than befriend them</b>. <br/><br/>

        <item><![CDATA[ <b>A long time ago</b>, in a <b>deep forest</b>, there lived a <b>cruel and greedy lion</b>. <br/><br/>
He hunted relentlessly, killing many animals. <br/><br/>
The terrified animals gathered and decided to approach the lion with a proposal: <b>each day, one animal from a different species would voluntarily offer itself as his meal</b>. <br/><br/>
This way, the lion would have food, and the rest of the animals could live in peace. <br/><br/>

The lion agreed, and from that day, one animal went to him daily. <br/><br/>
Eventually, it was <b>the rabbits\' turn</b>. <br/><br/>
The rabbits chose an <b>old and wise rabbit</b> to face the lion. <br/><br/>
The clever rabbit decided to <b>take his time</b> before going to the lion. <br/><br/>

Meanwhile, the impatient lion grew angry when no animal arrived and <b>swore to kill all the animals the next day</b>. <br/><br/>

By <b>sunset</b>, the rabbit finally appeared before the lion. <br/><br/>
The furious lion roared, <br/><br/>
<b>"Why are you so late?"</b> <br/><br/>

The wise rabbit, remaining calm, said, <br/><br/>
<b>"O mighty king, it is not my fault. A group of rabbits was on the way to you, but another lion attacked us. He devoured all the rabbits except me. I barely managed to escape to bring you this news."</b> <br/><br/>

Hearing about another lion in the forest, the lion <b>became enraged</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>"Another lion? In my kingdom? How dare he challenge my supremacy?"</b> he roared. <br/><br/>
<b>"Take me to him at once!"</b> <br/><br/>

The clever rabbit agreed and led the lion to a <b>deep well filled with water</b>. <br/><br/>
Pointing inside, he said, <b>"The other lion is hiding here."</b> <br/><br/>

The lion peered into the well and saw <b>his own reflection</b> in the water. <br/><br/>
Mistaking it for a real lion, he <b>growled</b>, and naturally, his reflection appeared to growl back. <br/><br/>

Believing it to be his <b>rival</b>, the furious lion <b>leaped into the well to attack</b>, only to <b>drown in the deep water</b>. <br/><br/>

Thus, the <b>wise rabbit</b> had outwitted the cruel lion, saving all the animals in the forest from his tyranny. <br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b> <br/><br/>
<b>Intelligence is greater than strength.</b> Cleverness and wisdom can overcome even the mightiest power. <br/><br/> ]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, a goat was grazing on the <b>grassy slope</b> of a hill near a stream. <br/><br/>
It noticed that the grass on the hills across the stream looked greener and more tempting. <br/><br/>
A <b>narrow log</b> served as a bridge across the stream, so the goat decided to cross. <br/><br/>

As it carefully walked across, it saw <b>another goat</b> coming from the opposite side. <br/><br/>
The bridge was so <b>narrow</b> that only one goat could cross at a time. <br/><br/>

The first goat said, <b>"Let me pass first."</b> <br/><br/>
The other goat replied, <b>"No! You let me pass first."</b> <br/><br/>

Both goats refused to give way. <br/><br/>
They began threatening each other, and soon, a <b>terrible fight</b> broke out. <br/><br/>
In the struggle, they <b>lost their balance</b> and fell into the rushing stream below. <br/><br/>

The other goats grazing nearby watched the scene and <b>learned an important lesson</b>. <br/><br/>

A few days later, a similar situation occurred. <br/><br/>
Two other goats met in the middle of the <b>same narrow bridge</b>, facing each other and unable to move forward. <br/><br/>

This time, one goat calmly said, <b>"I’ll sit down so you can step over my back."</b> <br/><br/>

The other goat carefully stepped over and safely crossed to the other side. <br/><br/>
Then, the second goat turned back and said, <b>"Thank you! Next time, I’ll sit down and let you cross first."</b> <br/><br/>

<b>Thus, both goats crossed the bridge safely, proving that cooperation and kindness are always better than stubbornness and conflict.</b> <br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b> <br/><br/>
<b>Cooperation and humility lead to success, while stubbornness and pride lead to failure.</b> <br/><br/> ]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, there lived a brave and intelligent King in his kingdom. <br/><br/>
He fought many battles, and each time, he emerged victorious, saving his kingdom from enemies. <br/><br/>

One day, a great battle took place. The King was on the verge of winning when his enemy launched a surprise attack from behind. <br/><br/>
Though the King ultimately defeated and killed his enemy, he suffered a grave injury, losing one eye and one leg in the battle. <br/><br/>

Many days passed. <br/><br/>
One day, the King gathered all the painters in his kingdom and asked them to paint a beautiful portrait of him. <br/><br/>

However, none of them dared to do so. How could they paint a flawless portrait of a King with only one eye and one leg? <br/><br/>

At last, one skilled artist stepped forward and agreed to paint the portrait. <br/><br/>

When the painting was unveiled, everyone was amazed. It was truly a masterpiece! <br/><br/>

The painter had cleverly depicted the King in a hunting position—
The King was shown aiming his bow, with one eye closed for focus and one leg bent while riding his horse. <br/><br/>

The King was delighted and rewarded the painter generously. <br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b> <br/><br/>
<b>Instead of focusing on weaknesses, always highlight strengths. Everyone has flaws, but true wisdom lies in seeing the best in people.</b> <br/><br/> ]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, there was a crow that lived in a jungle. <br/><br/>
The crow was black as coal, and he lived in a beautiful jungle where everything was vibrant and colorful. <br/><br/>

However, the crow was unhappy because he considered himself ugly compared to the other beautiful animals. <br/><br/>
He was especially envious of the swan, whose feathers were as white as the purest snow. <br/><br/>

One day, the crow approached the swan and said, <br/><br/>
"You look so beautiful! Will you tell me the secret of your whiteness?" <br/><br/>

The swan smiled and replied, <br/><br/>
"Why not! The secret of my whiteness lies in my dwelling in the water all the time." <br/><br/>

The foolish crow thought that if he lived like the swan—swimming and diving all day long and eating the same food—the color of his feathers would change to white. <br/><br/>

Determined, the crow left the jungle, abandoned his trees, and flew down to live in the lake. <br/><br/>
He dived into the water, ate what the swan ate, and washed himself repeatedly. <br/><br/>

However, no matter how much he washed, his feathers remained as black as ever. <br/><br/>
Moreover, the food he ate was not suited for him, and he became weaker and thinner. <br/><br/>

Eventually, after days of struggling, the poor crow died. <br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b> <br/><br/>
<b>A change in habits will not alter one\'s nature. Be yourself and embrace who you are.</b> <br/><br/> ]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, there was a village near a forest. <br/><br/>
A shepherd boy used to graze his sheep in the jungle every day. However, he was foolish and a liar. He often felt bored and wanted to play tricks on others. <br/><br/>

One day, he decided to play a joke on his neighbors. <br/><br/>
He climbed onto a rock and started shouting at the top of his voice, <br/><br/>
<b>“Wolf! Wolf! I am in danger! The wolf is killing my sheep! Please help!”</b> <br/><br/>

On hearing his cries, the villagers came running with sticks to help him. <br/><br/>
But when they reached the jungle, they found no wolf at all. The shepherd laughed loudly at them. <br/><br/>

The villagers realized that the boy had fooled them. <br/><br/>
Angry and disappointed, they returned to their village, saying, <br/><br/>
<b>“We will never believe him again!”</b> <br/><br/>

A few days later, a real wolf appeared and attacked his sheep. <br/><br/>
Terrified, the boy shouted as loudly as he could, <br/><br/>
<b>“Wolf! Wolf! He is killing my sheep! Please help me! I am telling the truth this time!”</b> <br/><br/>

However, the villagers thought he was lying again. <br/><br/>
They ignored his cries and did not come to help him. <br/><br/>

The wolf killed many sheep and took some away with him. <br/><br/>
The foolish boy lost everything just because he was a liar. <br/><br/>

The <b>hare</b>, in an <b>anxious</b> voice, replied, <b>"I was just wondering about you."</b>

The <b>fox</b> raised an eyebrow and asked, <b>"Oh? And why is that?"</b>

The <b>hare</b> hesitated for a moment and then said, <b>"People say you are very cunning, but I was thinking—maybe the <b>leopard</b> is even more cunning than you."</b>

The <b>fox</b> gave a <b>thoughtful</b> look and, after a short pause, said, <b>"You might be right. But let’s do one thing. Come to my <b>den</b> tonight and join our <b>meeting</b>. We shall discuss this matter."</b>

<br/> <br/>
One morning, a <b>wild elephant</b>, overcome by <b>spring fever</b>, wandered through the forest in search of fresh branches to eat. In his <b>rage</b>, he broke the very branch where the <b>sparrow’s nest</b> rested.

Tragically, all the <b>sparrow’s eggs</b> were lost, though both the <b>sparrow</b> and her <b>husband</b> survived.

The <b>she-sparrow</b> was heartbroken and wept uncontrollably.

<br/> <br/>
Seeing her sorrow, her friend, the <b>woodpecker</b>, consoled her and promised to find a way to punish the <b>elephant</b>.

The <b>woodpecker</b> then sought help from her friend, the <b>black fly</b>. In turn, the <b>black fly</b> consulted the wise <b>counselor frog</b> for advice.

The <b>frog</b> devised a clever plan to take <b>revenge</b> on the <b>elephant</b>.

<br/> <br/>
He instructed the <b>black fly</b> to buzz in the <b>elephant’s ears</b>, making him feel enchanted by the soothing sound. This would cause the <b>elephant</b> to close his eyes.

Then, the <b>woodpecker</b> was to swiftly <b>pluck out</b> the <b>elephant’s eyes</b>, leaving him <b>blind</b>.

Finally, the <b>frog</b> would sit at the edge of a deep <b>pit</b> and croak loudly. The <b>blind elephant</b>, mistaking the sound for a <b>pond</b>, would walk toward it and fall into the <b>pit</b>.

<br/> <br/>
The next day, at <b>noon</b>, the three friends executed their plan perfectly.

The <b>black fly</b> buzzed in the <b>elephant’s ears</b>, making him close his <b>eyes</b>.

At that moment, the <b>woodpecker</b> plucked out his <b>eyes</b>, blinding him completely.

Hearing the <b>frog’s croaking</b>, the <b>elephant</b> assumed there was a pond ahead and walked forward—only to fall into the deep <b>pit</b>, never to rise again.

Thus, with their <b>collective intelligence</b>, the three friends avenged the <b>sparrow</b> and brought justice.

It was <b>winter season</b>. One night, the weather was <b>cold and silent</b>.

<br/><br/>

The monkeys were sitting on a <b>big tree</b>, shivering.

<br/><br/>

They <b>held the branches tightly</b> with their hands, trying to keep warm.

<br/><br/>

One of the monkeys said, "If we could find some fire, it would keep us warm."

<br/><br/>

So, they started <b>searching for fire</b>.

<br/><br/>

Suddenly, they saw a <b>group of fireflies</b> coming out of a small hole.

<br/><br/>

One of the <b>young monkeys</b> thought it was <b>fire</b>.

<br/><br/>

Excitedly, he told his friends, "Let’s catch the fire!"

<br/><br/>

Saying this, he <b>caught a firefly</b>, placed it under <b>dry leaves and sticks</b>, and started blowing on it.

<br/><br/>

The <b>other monkeys</b> also joined him and began <b>blowing</b> with their mouths.

<br/><br/>

Meanwhile, a <b>sparrow</b> was flying to her <b>nest</b>, which was on the <b>same tree</b> where the monkeys were sitting.

<br/><br/>

She noticed what they were doing and <b>laughed</b>.

<br/><br/>

The sparrow said, "You all are so foolish! That is a firefly, not real fire. If you catch fire, it will burn your hands. Instead of wasting your energy, you should take shelter in a cave. You will feel warm inside."

<br/><br/>

However, the monkeys <b>ignored</b> the sparrow’s advice.

<br/><br/>

They <b>continued blowing</b> at the firefly, hoping to make fire.

<br/><br/>

After a long time, the <b>monkeys became very tired</b>.

<br/><br/>

Now, they <b>realized</b> that the sparrow had been right.

The tiger was <b>hungry</b> and wanted to kill and eat Baula. Just as he was about to <b>attack</b>, Baula made a heartfelt plea.

She said, "Oh mighty tiger, I have a young calf waiting for me at home. If you kill me now, my calf will die of hunger. Please let me return just once, so I can feed my child. I promise to come back to you."

The tiger <b>laughed</b> and said, "That is impossible! If I let you go, you will never return."

Baula replied sincerely, "I give you my word. I will return after feeding my calf. Honesty is my greatest virtue."

The tiger, amazed by her confidence, agreed and said, "Fine, but you must come back very soon."

<br/><br/>

He said, "I have never seen such sincerity, morality, and honesty in any animal before. Your character is truly inspiring!"

Filled with admiration, the tiger declared, "I cannot harm you. Instead, I will protect you from other wild animals in the future. Your honesty must be an example for all."

One day, the mother crab and her baby were walking together. The baby crab was <b>walking a little ahead</b> of its mother.

After some time, the mother crab said, "Oh, my dear child, why do you bend to one side when you walk?"

<br/><br/>

The baby crab <b>turned back</b>, looked at its mother, and asked, "Why, Mother? What is wrong with the way I walk? Do I not look good walking like this?"

<br/><br/>

The mother crab replied, "No, it does not look good to me. You would look much better if you walked straight and forward."

<br/><br/>

The baby crab thought for a moment and said, "That might be true, Mother. But I do not know how to walk straight. If you show me how to do it, I promise I will start walking straight from this moment onward."

The mother crab <b>impatiently agreed</b> and said, "Watch me carefully, and you will learn."

As the fox peered into the well, a <b>goat</b> also arrived, feeling equally thirsty. Both were desperate for water, so they <b>jumped into the well</b> to quench their thirst.

The <b>goat</b>, unaware of the fox’s <b>trickery</b>, agreed. He stood still, and the <b>fox</b> swiftly climbed up and jumped out of the well.

        <item><![CDATA[On a <b>dark, cold winter’s night</b>, a <b>hungry jackal</b> wandered into a village, desperately searching for food. The harsh winter had left the forest barren, and there was nothing left to eat. <br/><br/>

<b>"Perhaps I will find something in the village,"</b> thought the jackal as he cautiously made his way toward the human settlement. <br/><br/>

However, as soon as he entered, a group of <b>village dogs</b> heard his footsteps. Dogs and jackals are natural enemies, and the moment they spotted him, they <b>barked, growled, and charged</b> at him from all sides! <br/><br/>

Terrified, the poor jackal <b>ran for his life</b>, dodging sharp claws and snapping jaws. Through the dark, deserted streets he sped, with the furious dogs in pursuit, their snarls echoing through the night. <br/><br/>

Just when he thought he could not run any longer, he saw a <b>courtyard wall</b> ahead. Without hesitation, he leaped over it and <b>landed straight into a large pot of indigo dye!</b> <br/><br/>

The dye had been left by a <b>cloth dyer</b>, ready for use in the morning. Now, the jackal was completely <b>dyed a rich blue color!</b> <br/><br/>

Meanwhile, the dogs had lost track of their prey. They sniffed around the courtyard wall but could neither see nor smell the jackal anymore. Confused and frustrated, they eventually gave up and ran off. <br/><br/>

When the jackal cautiously <b>stepped out</b> of the dye pot, he was astonished. His fur had turned <b>a deep shade of indigo</b>! As he made his way back to the forest, every animal he passed <b>fled in terror</b>. None of them recognized him as a jackal anymore! <br/><br/>

Seeing how the animals feared him, the <b>cunning jackal hatched a plan</b>. <br/><br/>

He called all the creatures of the forest together and <b>addressed them in a grand voice</b>: <br/><br/>

<b>“My dear animals, do not be afraid. I have been sent by the gods themselves to protect you and bring peace to the jungle. From now on, I shall be your king! In return, you must serve me and obey my commands. Otherwise, the gods will be angry with you.”</b> <br/><br/>

The frightened animals <b>believed his words</b>. They bowed before him and declared him <b>the King of the Forest</b>. From that day on, they brought him food and cared for his every need. The indigo jackal was never hungry or cold again. <br/><br/>

Many months passed this way. One day, a <b>pack of wild jackals</b> came to live in the forest. Every time the indigo jackal saw them, <b>a deep longing stirred within him</b>—he missed being with his own kind. <br/><br/>

One night, under a <b>bright full moon</b>, the jackal pack lifted their heads and let out a <b>long, mournful howl</b>. The sound sent a <b>thrill through the indigo jackal’s heart</b>. He could no longer resist. <b>Forgetting his disguise and his lies</b>, he too <b>threw back his head and howled!</b> <br/><br/>

The moment the other animals heard him, they <b>realized the truth</b>—their so-called "king" was nothing but an <b>ordinary jackal</b> who had tricked them! <br/><br/>

Furious at being deceived, they turned against him. The indigo jackal tried to run, but the <b>enraged animals</b> chased after him. <b>Caught and surrounded, he was torn to pieces.</b> <br/><br/>

In the end, the jackal paid the price for <b>pretending to be someone he was not</b>. <br/><br/>

Word of the toad’s claim spread throughout the forest. When the <b>clever fox</b> heard about it, he became curious. <b>"A toad who is a doctor?"</b> he thought. <b>"I must go and see if this is true."</b> <br/><br/>

The next morning, the fox set off from the forest and made his way toward the pond, where the toad and his family lived. When he reached the place, he carefully <b>examined the toad</b> from head to toe. <br/><br/>

With a smirk, the fox said, <b>"Mr. Toad, I have heard that you are a great doctor who can cure any disease! But before you try to heal others, just take a look at yourself. You have blotchy skin and a stiff, rheumatic walk. Why don’t you try some of your own medicine first?"</b> <br/><br/>

The toad was speechless. He had no answer to the fox’s sharp words. <br/><br/>

The fox laughed and continued, <b>"If you could cure yourself and become healthy, perhaps someone might believe in your skills. But in your current state, I would advise you to find a profession more suitable for you."</b> <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

There was a slave living in the kingdom. He was treated very badly by his master. He was sick of his harsh rules, so he ran away from the kingdom. He went to a dense forest.

<br/><br/>

He took shelter in a cave. There he saw a lion crying in pain. There was a thorn in his right paw. Boldly, the slave moved towards the lion. He removed the thorn from the lion’s paw. The lion felt relieved and stopped crying.

<br/><br/>

The king’s men were searching everywhere for the slave. Soon they caught him alive.

<br/><br/>

The king ordered that the slave be thrown before a hungry lion in front of the public. This was his punishment for running away from the kingdom. Inside the arena, the slave was left alone in a cage. People watched him from a distance.

<br/><br/>

When the door of the cage opened, the lion ran out roaring. But to the surprise of everyone, the lion licked the hands of the slave in sheer gratitude.

<br/><br/>

The king wanted to know the reason for the lion’s strange behavior towards the slave. The happy slave narrated his story. The king was very pleased with the slave and set him and the lion free.

<br/><br/>

There were no more slaves in Greece after this incident, and everyone lived happily.

Every day, the Arab used his camel to carry his belongings from one place to another. One night, the weather was extremely cold, so the Arab set up a tent to rest. That night, the Arab lay asleep inside the tent, while the camel stood outside.

<br><br>

At midnight, the camel woke up his master and requested permission to put his head inside the tent as it was bitterly cold outside. The Arab agreed.

<br><br>

After a while, the camel asked if he could put his neck inside the tent because it was too cold outside. The Arab did not object.

Soon after, the camel requested again to bring his legs inside. The Arab agreed. Now, the camel stood completely inside the tent. But as there was not enough space for both of them, he pushed the Arab outside, leaving him to shiver in the cold.

<b>"I have a little calf at home who is waiting for me. If you kill me now, my poor baby will die of hunger. Please, let me go just for a while so that I can feed my calf. I promise to return to you afterward."</b>

<br><br>

The tiger growled,
<b>"That is impossible! If I let you go, you will never come back."</b>

<br><br>

Baula replied sincerely,
<b>"I give you my word. I will return after feeding my calf. Please trust me."</b>

<br><br>

The tiger was surprised by Baula\'s honesty and decided to let her go, saying,

<br><br>

Baula rushed back home and <b>fed her calf</b>. She gently told her little one,
<b>"I will be back soon, my dear."</b>

True to her word, Baula returned to the jungle and called out for the tiger. The tiger was <b>shocked</b> to see her back. Though he was <b>hungry</b>, he was deeply <b>moved</b> by her <b>honesty</b> and <b>loyalty</b>.

<br><br>

The tiger said,

<br><br>

He continued,

Saying this, the tiger walked away into the jungle, and Baula returned safely to her calf before sunrise.

<br><br>

After some time, the mother crab said,
<b>"Oh, my dear child, why do you bend to one side when you walk?"</b>

<br><br>

The baby crab turned back, looked at its mother, and asked,
<b>"Why, Mother? What is wrong with the way I walk? Do I not look good walking like this?"</b>

<br><br>

The mother crab replied,
<b>"No, my dear. It does not look good to me. You would look much better if you walked straight and forward."</b>

<br><br>

The young crab thought for a moment and said,
<b>"That might be true, Mother. But I do not know how to walk straight. If you show me how, I promise to do it from this moment onward."</b>

<br><br>

The mother crab impatiently agreed and said,
<b>"Watch me carefully, and you will learn."</b>

<br><br>

She then tried to walk straight, but it was impossible for her. No matter how much she tried, she could not walk straight.

<br><br>

Tired and embarrassed, she finally said to her son,
<b>"I am sorry for scolding you. I myself cannot walk straight. How can I ask you to do something I cannot do?"</b>

<br><br>

She then smiled and said,
<b>"You may continue to walk the way you do!"</b>

<br><br>

And so, they happily continued on their journey.

<br><br>

It was a hot summer day, and the fox was very thirsty. Looking around for a place to quench his thirst, he came across a well that had very little water in it.

<br><br>

At the same time, a goat also arrived at the well, looking for water. They were both so thirsty that they jumped into the well to quench their thirst.

<br><br>

After drinking, the goat looked around and asked,
<b>"How will we get out of this well?"</b>

<br><br>

The fox, being clever and cunning, quickly came up with a plan. He said,
<b>"Don’t worry. Leave that to me. All you have to do is stand firm while I climb up using your back. Once I get out, I will pull you up."</b>

<br><br>

The goat, unaware of the fox’s shrewdness, agreed. The fox quickly climbed onto the goat’s back, jumped out of the well, and stood at the edge.

<br><br>

The goat looked up and said,
<b>"Now, please help me out!"</b>

<br><br>

But the fox smirked and said,
<b>"You should have thought before jumping in. Always think before you act!"</b>

<br><br>

Saying this, the fox walked away, leaving the poor goat trapped in the well.

<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> <b>Think before you act. Do not trust cunning people blindly.</b>]]></item>

<br><br>

It was winter season, and one night, the weather was cold and silent. The monkeys were sitting on a big tree, holding onto the branches tightly with their hands.

<br><br>

One of the monkeys said,
<b>"If we could find some fire, it would help us stay warm."</b>

<br><br>

Hearing this, all the monkeys started searching for fire.

<br><br>

Suddenly, they saw a group of fireflies coming out of a small hole. One of the young monkeys thought it was fire. He excitedly told his friends,
<b>"Let's catch the fire!"</b>

<br><br>

Saying this, he caught a firefly, placed it under dry leaves and sticks, and started blowing at it to make fire. Other monkeys also joined in, blowing with their mouths.

<br><br>

A sparrow was flying to her nest on the same tree. She noticed what the monkeys were doing and laughed.

<br><br>

The sparrow said,
<b>"You all are foolish! That is a firefly, not real fire. If you catch fire, it will burn your hands. Instead of wasting your energy, you should take shelter in a cave. Inside the cave, you will feel warm."</b>

<br><br>

But the monkeys ignored the sparrow and continued blowing at the firefly.

<br><br>

After some time, the monkeys became very tired. Now, they realized that what the sparrow had said was correct.

<br><br>

They set the firefly free and thanked the sparrow. Finally, they all moved to a nearby cave to keep themselves warm.

<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> <b>Wise advice should always be listened to.</b> ]]></item>

<br><br>

The winter had been long and harsh, and there was no food left in the forest.

<b>“Perhaps,”</b> thought the jackal, <b>“I will find something to eat in the village.”</b>

<br><br>

He soon started walking toward the village, howling along the way. Some dogs heard him.

<br><br>

In nature, dogs disliked jackals. They began barking, growling, and soon attacked the jackal from all sides.

<br><br>

They scratched and bit him with their sharp claws and big teeth.

<br><br>

Terrified, the poor jackal ran as fast as he could through the dark, deserted streets of the village. But the dogs did not give up—they ran after him, growling, snarling, and barking even louder.

<br><br>

The jackal did not know what to do. He could not stop, and he knew he could not outrun them forever.

<br><br>

Suddenly, he saw a courtyard wall before him.

<b>Without thinking, he jumped over it**—straight into a large pot of indigo dye!</b>

<br><br>

The dye had been left there by a dyer, ready to be used in the morning.

Now, the jackal was dyed a rich indigo color!

<br><br>

Meanwhile, the dogs had stopped barking. They could neither see nor smell the jackal anymore.

They decided to wait near the courtyard wall, just in case he appeared again.

<br><br>

But instead of the jackal, a strange blue creature came creeping out of the dyer’s house!

<br><br>

The dogs were terrified—they had never seen such a creature before.

Much to the jackal’s surprise, instead of attacking him, the dogs ran away, yelping in fear.

<br><br>

A bit puzzled, but also pleased with the dogs’ fright, the jackal returned to the forest.

<br><br>

Every forest creature that saw him also ran away, squealing in terror.

The jackal soon realized it was his strange new color that was scaring all the animals away.

They did not recognize him as a jackal anymore.

<br><br>

The cunning jackal then hatched a plan.

He called all the animals to him.

<br><br>

When they had gathered before him, trembling, he said,

<b>“Dear animals, do not be afraid. I will not harm you.

I have been sent by the gods themselves to look after you, to make sure you come to no harm.

In return, you must make me your king and obey my commands.

If you refuse, the gods will be angry with you.”</b>

<br><br>

The frightened animals agreed.

They made him the king of the forest and did everything he asked.

Now, the jackal had plenty to eat.

He was never cold or hungry anymore.

<br><br>

Many months passed.

One day, a pack of jackals came to live in the forest.

Whenever the indigo jackal saw them, he felt a strange desire to be with them—to be a jackal once again.

<br><br>

One night, when the moon was full, the entire jackal pack lifted their heads and howled.

The indigo jackal could not stop himself.

Forgetting his lies, he too lifted his head and howled with the other jackals.

<br><br>

When the animals saw this, they realized they had been tricked.

Their king was nothing but a common jackal!

<br><br>

They were angry with themselves for being fooled—and furious with the jackal.

<br><br>

Seeing that the animals had discovered the truth, the jackal tried to run away.

But the furious animals chased him, caught him, and tore him to pieces.

<br><br>

In the end, it wasn’t a very good idea for the jackal to pretend to be someone he was not, was it?

<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> <b>Pretending to be someone you are not will always lead to trouble.</b>]]></item>

<br><br>

One day, the old toad informed all his neighbors that he was a learned doctor.

<b>“I can cure anything—without any fees!”</b> he claimed.

<br><br>

When the fox heard the news, he was intrigued and hurried to see the toad.

He decided to reach the place in the morning.

Leaving the forest, he walked toward the pond where the toad lived with his family.

<br><br>

Upon arriving, the fox carefully observed the toad and then said,

<b>“Mr. Toad, I heard that you are a great doctor and can cure anything!

But just take a look at yourself first—your blotchy skin, your slow, stiff walk.

If you can cure yourself of these, then someone might actually believe you.

Otherwise, I’d suggest you try a profession that suits you better!”</b>

Hearing this, the toad was speechless.

        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there was a <b>grasshopper</b> hopping, chirping, and singing to its heart’s content in a field on a hot <b>summer’s day</b>.<br><br>

Nearby, an <b>ant</b> lived close to the grasshopper’s nest. They were good friends. It was <b>springtime</b>, and while the grasshopper spent his days playing, singing, and dancing in the sun, the <b>ant</b> worked hard, collecting <b>food grains</b> and storing them in his house for the <b>winter</b>.<br><br>

The grasshopper didn’t understand why the ant worked so hard and asked,
<b>"Hey, Ant! Why don’t you come outside and play with me?"</b><br><br>

The ant replied,
<b>"I cannot. I am storing food for the winter when there won’t be anything to eat!"</b><br><br>

The grasshopper laughed and said,
<b>"Why are you worrying now? There’s plenty of food!"</b>
He continued playing while the ant worked diligently.<br><br>

When <b>winter</b> came, the grasshopper couldn’t find a single grain of food. He began to starve and feel very weak.<br><br>

Meanwhile, the hardworking ant had plenty of food stored up for the cold months. Seeing this, the grasshopper finally realized the importance of hard work and regretted his laziness.<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> <b>Make hay while the sun shines.</b> (It’s important to plan ahead and work hard when the time is right.)]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[There was a <b>crow</b>. On a hot <b>summer day</b>, he was very thirsty. He flew from place to place in search of water but could not find it anywhere, which made him sad and disappointed.<br><br>

At last, he saw a <b>pot of water</b>. He flew down to the pot and sat on its edge. When he craned his beak to quench his thirst, he saw, to his great discouragement, that the water was just at the bottom.<br><br>

His beak could not reach the water at such a low level. He even tried to overturn the pot but couldn’t, as it was too heavy for him to move.<br><br>

Just as he was about to fly away in despair, he thought of a plan. Suddenly, his eyes fell upon some <b>pebbles</b> lying nearby. He flew to them, picked up the pebbles one by one, and dropped them into the pot. Slowly and gradually, the level of water rose and came up to the neck of the pot.<br><br>

The crow was overjoyed to see this. He dipped his beak, quenched his thirst, and flew away happily.<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> <b>Where there is a will, there is a way.</b> (With determination and clever thinking, any problem can be solved.)]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there was a <b>hare</b> who, boasting how he could run faster than anyone else, was forever teasing the <b>tortoise</b> for its slowness.<br><br>

One day, the irate tortoise answered back, "Who do you think you are? There’s no denying you’re swift, but even you can be beaten!"<br><br>

The hare squealed with laughter. "Beaten in a race? By whom? Not you, surely! I bet there’s nobody in the world that can win against me, I’m so speedy. Now, why don’t you try?"<br><br>

Annoyed by such bragging, the tortoise accepted the challenge. A course was planned, and the next day at dawn, they stood at the starting line.<br><br>

The hare yawned sleepily as the meek tortoise trudged slowly off. When the hare saw how painfully slow his rival was, he decided, half asleep on his feet, to have a quick nap. "Take your time!" he said. "I’ll have forty winks and catch up with you in a minute."<br><br>

The hare woke with a start from a fitful sleep and gazed around, looking for the tortoise. But the creature was only a short distance away, having barely covered a third of the course. Breathing a sigh of relief, the hare decided he might as well have breakfast too and went off to munch some cabbages he had noticed in a nearby field.<br><br>

The heavy meal and the hot sun made his eyelids droop. With a careless glance at the tortoise, now halfway along the course, he decided to have another snooze before flashing past the winning post. Smiling at the thought of the look on the tortoise’s face when it saw him speed by, he fell fast asleep and was soon snoring happily.<br><br>

As the sun started to sink below the horizon, the tortoise, who had been plodding steadily toward the winning post since morning, was scarcely a yard from the finish. At that very moment, the hare woke with a jolt. He could see the tortoise as a speck in the distance, and away he dashed.<br><br>

He leaped and bounded at a great rate, his tongue lolling and gasping for breath. Just a little more, and he’d be first at the finish. But the hare’s last leap was just too late, for the tortoise had already beaten him to the winning post.<br><br>

Poor hare! Tired and in disgrace, he slumped down beside the tortoise, who was silently smiling at him.<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> <b>Slow and steady wins the race</b> or <b>Pride hath a fall.</b>]]></item>

Just then, a <b>fairy</b> appeared from the river, holding out a <b>golden ax</b> to him. "I found this ax in the river. Is this yours?" she asked.<br><br>

"That’s not mine," replied the woodcutter.<br><br>

The fairy then brought out a <b>silver ax</b>. The woodcutter disowned this one too.<br><br>

Finally, the fairy held out a simple <b>wooden ax</b>.<br><br>

Smiling with happiness, the woodcutter said, "That’s mine. Thank you very much."<br><br>

The fairy felt very happy seeing his honesty and said, "Such honesty deserves a reward." She gave the poor man all three axes and disappeared.<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> <b>Honesty is the best policy.</b> Always be honest.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, two <b>cats</b> found a piece of <b>cheese</b> and cut it into two pieces. But one piece was slightly bigger than the other. Both the cats wanted the bigger piece, so they started to quarrel with each other.<br><br>

A <b>monkey</b> sitting on a branch of a tree had watched everything that happened between the two cats. "That piece of cheese looks good. I could do with it myself," he thought. Slowly, he came down from the tree and walked up to the confused cats.<br><br>

"Oh, my dear friends! Can I help you?" asked the monkey.<br><br>

The cats told the monkey about their problem and said, "Why don’t you be the judge between us?"<br><br>

When the monkey nodded, the cats said, "Please divide this cheese for us and sort out the matter."<br><br>

The monkey said, "Don’t worry. I’ll make both the pieces equal." Then, he took a bite from the bigger piece. But this made the other piece larger, so he took a bite from the other piece. This continued until the pieces became very small.<br><br>

Seeing this, the cats pleaded, "Sir! We are satisfied. Let us have the pieces now."<br><br>

The shrewd monkey replied, "This is my fee for sorting out the problem." Saying this, he gobbled up the remaining cheese, jumped back onto the tree, and was gone.<br><br>

"If only we had not quarreled among ourselves, we would have remained united and wouldn’t have gone to the monkey. Now we are left hungry," said the two cats. Both cats went home silently.<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> <b>When you quarrel, others benefit.</b>]]></item>

Every time the experienced fisherman caught a <b>big fish</b>, he put it in his ice chest to keep it fresh. Whenever the inexperienced fisherman caught a big fish, he threw it back.<br><br>

The experienced fisherman watched this go on all day and finally got tired of seeing the man waste good fish. "Why do you keep throwing back all the big fish you catch?" he asked.<br><br>

The inexperienced fisherman replied, "I only have a <b>small frying pan</b>."<br><br>

Sometimes, like that fisherman, we throw back the <b>big plans</b>, <b>big dreams</b>, <b>big jobs</b>, and <b>big opportunities</b> that God gives us because our <b>faith</b> is too small.<br><br>

We laugh at that fisherman who didn’t realize that all he needed was a <b>bigger frying pan</b>. Yet, how ready are we to increase the size of our <b>faith</b>?<br><br>

Whether it’s a <b>problem</b> or a <b>possibility</b>, God will never give you anything bigger than you can handle. That means we can confidently walk into anything God brings our way.<br><br>

<b>REMEMBER:</b><br>
Stop telling God you’ve got <b>big problems</b>.<br>
Tell your problems you’ve got a <b>BIG GOD</b>!]]></item>

        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there was a <b>fox</b> living in the forest. One day, while <b>strolling through the woods</b>, he came upon a <b>grape orchard</b>. There, he found a bunch of beautiful <b>grapes</b> hanging from a high branch.<br><br>

<b>"Wow! Those sure would be tasty,"</b> he thought to himself.<br><br>

He backed up, took a running start, and <b>jumped</b>. But he didn’t get high enough. Determined, he went back to his starting spot and tried again. This time, he almost reached the grapes—but not quite.<br><br>

He tried again and again, but no matter what, he just couldn’t get high enough to grab the grapes.<br><br>

Finally, he gave up. As he walked away, he lifted his nose in the air and said:<br>
<b>"I am sure those grapes are sour anyway."</b><br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> It is easy to scorn what you cannot get.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once, <b>three fishes</b> lived in a pond. One evening, some <b>fishermen</b> passed by the pond and saw the fishes. <br><br>

<b>"This pond is full of fish,"</b> they told each other excitedly. <b>"We have never fished here before. We must come back tomorrow morning with our nets and catch these fish!"</b> So, the fishermen left. <br><br>

When the <b>eldest</b> of the three fishes heard this, he was troubled. He called the other fishes together and said, <br><br>
<b>"Did you hear what the fishermen said? We must leave this pond at once. The fishermen will return tomorrow and kill us all!"</b> <br><br>

The <b>second fish</b> agreed. <b>"You are right,"</b> he said. <b>"We must leave the pond."</b> <br><br>

But the <b>youngest fish</b> laughed. <b>"You are worrying without reason,"</b> he said. <b>"We have lived in this pond all our lives, and no fisherman has ever come here. Why should these men return? I am not going anywhere—my luck will keep me safe."</b> <br><br>

That very evening, the <b>eldest fish</b> left the pond with his entire family. Early the next morning, the <b>second fish</b> saw the fishermen approaching in the distance and quickly left with all his family. The <b>third fish</b>, however, refused to leave. <br><br>

The fishermen arrived and caught all the fish left in the pond. The youngest fish’s luck did not help him—he too was caught and killed. <br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> The fish who saw trouble ahead and acted before it arrived, as well as the fish who acted as soon as danger came, both survived. But the fish who relied only on luck and did nothing perished. <br><br>
<b>Lesson:</b> In life, foresight and timely action are often the keys to survival.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once, in a certain lake, there lived a <b>turtle</b> and a pair of <b>swans</b>. The turtle and the swans were good friends. They would spend all their free time together, telling each other stories and exchanging news and gossip. The <b>turtle</b> especially loved to talk and chatter, always having something to say. <br><br>

One year, the rains did not come, and the lake began to dry up. The swans became worried. <b>"Supposing it does not rain at all, and the lake dries up completely? Where will we live then?"</b> they wondered. But the turtle had a plan. She suggested that the swans fly in search of a lake that still had plenty of water. Once they found such a lake, all three of them could move there. <br><br>

The swans agreed and flew off. After flying for several hours, they found the perfect lake. They returned to the turtle with the good news. But now another problem arose: the new lake was too far for the turtle to walk. How was the turtle to get there? The swans did not want to leave their friend behind. <br><br>

The turtle thought for a while and came up with another plan. She asked the swans to find a strong stick that they could hold in their beaks. The turtle would then hang on to the stick with her mouth, and the swans could fly with her to the new lake. <br><br>

The swans liked the idea, though they were worried that the turtle might begin talking and fall off the stick. <br><br>
<b>"You must be careful not to open your mouth while we are flying with you,"</b> they warned her. <b>"Do you think you will be able to stay quiet for such a long time?"</b>
<b>"Of course,"</b> said the turtle. <b>"I will be careful—I know when to stop talking."</b> <br><br>

So the swans did as she asked. They found a strong stick, and each swan held one end of it in its beak. The turtle held on to the middle with her mouth, and away they flew—all three of them. <br><br>

It was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to the turtle. She was amazed at how the world looked from so far above the ground. She was longing to say something but remembered in time to keep quiet. <br><br>

At last, they reached the lake the swans had found. It was a beautiful lake—large and blue, with plenty of water. <b>"Oh look!"</b> the turtle began in excitement, forgetting too late to stay silent. The stick slipped from her mouth, and down she fell from the sky onto the rocks below. <br><br>

The swans were sad to see the end of their friend. The turtle did not live to enjoy the new lake, all because she did not know when to stop talking. <br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> There is a time to speak and a time to remain silent. Knowing when to stay quiet can sometimes be the key to survival.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there lived an able <b>king</b> in Scotland. His name was <b>Robert Bruce</b>. He fought many battles, and nobody had ever defeated him in battle. <br><br>

However, one day, he was defeated by a cruel king. He ran away from the battlefield and hid in a <b>cave</b> situated in a big forest. <br><br>

There was a <b>spider</b> in that cave. It was trying to reach the roof of the cave. Again and again, it failed. After every fall, the spider tried once more. It did not lose heart and, after several attempts, finally reached its cobweb. <br><br>

The spider taught <b>King Bruce</b> a great lesson. It filled him with new hope and courage. He came out of the cave and gathered his forces. This time, he fought bravely and succeeded in making his country free. <br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> Try, try again till you succeed.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there was a <b>lion</b> who had been badly hurt by the horns of a <b>goat</b> while he was eating. He was very angry to think that any animal he chose for a meal could be so brazen as to wear such dangerous things as horns to scratch him while he ate. So, he commanded that all animals with <b>horns</b> should leave his kingdom as soon as possible. He didn’t want to see them at all. <br><br>

The command struck <b>terror</b> among all the animals. All those who were unfortunate enough to have horns started moving out of the jungle. Even a <b>hare</b>, who had no horns and nothing to fear, passed a very restless night, worrying about the fearful lion. <br><br>

Early the next morning, the hare came out of his <b>warren</b> and saw the shadow cast by his long, pointed ears. He was frightened by what he saw. <br><br>

“Goodbye, my dear friend <b>cricket</b>. I am leaving,” said the hare. <br><br>

The cricket replied, “Why are you leaving? You don’t have horns—you should stay here.” <br><br>

The hare, still terrified, responded, “The lion will surely mistake my ears for horns, no matter what I truly am.” <br><br>

Just then, the <b>lion</b> appeared with a loud roar and, without hesitation, killed the hare. <br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> Do not give your enemies the slightest reason to attack your reputation. They will seize any excuse to harm you.

        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there was a <b>fox</b> who lived in a dense forest. One day, he was very <b>hungry</b> and searched for food. As he was passing by a road near a <b>pond</b>, he saw a <b>turtle</b> roaming nearby. <br><br>

The hungry fox quickly caught the turtle. To eat it, he tried to break through the turtle’s solid shell, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t break it. <br><br>

“Hello, dear. Do you want to eat me? If so, you should try putting me in the water for a while to soften me up,” suggested the shrewd turtle. <br><br>

This sounded like excellent advice to the fox. He carried his prey to the pond and immersed it in the water. But the turtle, who was a <b>superb swimmer</b>, quickly slid out of the fox’s paws, swam to the middle of the pond, and laughed. <br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> Presence of mind can save you from danger.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there lived two best friends in a village. Their names were <b>Motu</b> and <b>Chhotu</b>. One day, both of them set out to attend their friend\'s birthday party. <br><br>

They promised to help each other in times of trouble. On the way, they had to pass through a big forest. As they were walking through the forest, they suddenly saw a <b>black bear</b> approaching them. They were terrified to see such a dangerous animal. <br><br>

Chhotu quickly climbed up a nearby tree to save his own life, forgetting all about his friend’s safety. <b>Motu</b>, on the other hand, did not know how to climb a tree because he was <b>fat</b>. But he was <b>intelligent</b>. He had once heard that bears do not touch dead people. So, he lay on the ground, held his breath, and pretended to be dead. <br><br>

The bear came close, sniffed Motu’s whole body, and thinking he was dead, walked away quietly. <br><br>

When the bear had gone far enough, Motu stood up on his own feet. Chhotu climbed down from the tree and asked, “What did the bear whisper in your ear?” <br><br>

Motu replied, “The bear advised me to beware of false friends like you.” <br><br>

Hearing this, Chhotu realized his mistake and felt ashamed of his actions. <br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> Beware of false friends.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there was a humble woodcutter named <b>Kalidas</b> living in a small village. The villagers depended on the forest for their livelihood. Kalidas regularly went to the forest to collect firewood with the other villagers. He would sell the wood in the nearby market, and with that little earning, he managed to support his family. <br><br>

One day, like his usual routine, Kalidas went to the forest to collect firewood. While cutting a tree near the river, misfortune struck—his <b>ax</b> slipped from his hands and fell into the river. Kalidas was a poor woodcutter and had only one ax. Losing his only tool left him devastated, and as he thought about his future, he began to weep bitterly. <br><br>

His intense crying disturbed the <b>Water God</b>, who appeared before Kalidas and asked why he was crying. Kalidas explained everything in detail. After listening patiently, the Water God plunged into the river and, after a while, came out with a <b>golden ax</b>. <br><br>

He showed the golden ax to Kalidas and asked, “<b>Is this yours?</b>” <br><br>

Kalidas examined the golden ax carefully and replied, “<b>No, my lord, it is not mine.</b>” <br><br>

The Water God set the golden ax aside and plunged into the river a second time. This time, he returned with a <b>silver ax</b> and asked again, “<b>Is this yours?</b>” <br><br>

Kalidas shook his head and said, “<b>No, my lord. I am a poor woodcutter. How could I own a golden or silver ax? I had only an iron ax.</b>” <br><br>

Hearing this, the Water God plunged into the river once more and returned with Kalidas’s original <b>iron ax</b>. When Kalidas saw his ax, he was overjoyed and expressed his deep gratitude and respect to the Water God. <br><br>

Impressed by Kalidas’s honesty, the Water God rewarded him with all three axes—the <b>golden</b>, <b>silver</b>, and his original <b>iron ax</b>. <br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> Always be honest. Honesty is always rewarded.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, in a dense forest, there lived a <b>jackal</b>. One day, he was very hungry and went in search of food. While wandering through the forest, he came across a <b>battlefield</b>. There, under a tree, he saw a big <b>drum</b>. <br><br>

When the wind blew, the branches of the tree hit the drum, creating strange sounds. The jackal was about to run away in fear but stopped and decided to carefully investigate the source of the sound. <br><br>

Curious, the jackal hit the drum with his front paws, and it made a loud noise. The jackal thought, "<b>There might be some small animal hiding inside the drum—maybe it would make a tasty meal for me.</b>" Hungry and desperate, he tried hard to tear the drum with his paws and teeth, but all his efforts were in vain. <br><br>

At that moment, a <b>leopard</b> passed by, searching for food. Attracted by the sound, the leopard approached the drum and saw the jackal. <br><br>

"<b>I will kill you and eat you!</b>" growled the leopard. <br><br>

The clever jackal quickly said, "<b>My dear friend, please spare me, and I will help you find a better meal. There’s a pig hiding inside this drum. If you tear it open, you’ll have a tasty feast.</b>" Saying this, the jackal vanished into the forest. <br><br>

The leopard, eager for a good meal, struck the drum with his sharp claws. The drum burst open with a loud noise—but there was nothing inside. The drum was completely empty. <br><br>

Furious, the leopard shouted, "<b>You have wasted my time! There’s no food inside the drum. I will find and eat you instead.</b>" <br><br>

However, the jackal was nowhere to be found. The leopard, still hungry, resumed his search for food. Fortunately, near the drum, he found some prey and satisfied his hunger. <br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> Use your presence of mind to escape from danger. Clever thinking can help you survive even in difficult situations.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once there lived a <b>stag</b> in a dense forest. There was a <b>stream</b> inside the forest, and all the animals used its water. The stag lived there peacefully with his family. One day, feeling very thirsty, he went to the stream to drink some water. The stream’s water was calm and clear. As he bent down to drink, something caught his eye. <br><br>

The stag saw his <b>reflection</b> in the clear water. He admired his majestic horns and thought to himself, "<b>How beautiful and lovely my horns are!</b>" His heart swelled with pride. But when his gaze shifted to his thin legs, he felt disappointed and cursed <b>God</b> for this perceived injustice. <br><br>

"<b>With such strong horns, I am surely the king of this forest!</b>" he thought proudly. "<b>Why should I fear anyone?</b>" <br><br>

Just as he was about to quench his thirst, he noticed a <b>hunter</b> approaching with his <b>hounds</b>. Sensing danger, the stag ran as fast as he could. His legs, which he had despised moments earlier, helped him swiftly escape the hunter’s sight. <br><br>

However, as he entered a thick part of the forest, his large horns got stuck in a bush. Despite trying his best to free himself, all efforts were in vain. Meanwhile, the hounds caught up and captured him. <br><br>

In his final moments, the stag realized, "<b>The legs I once despised could have saved my life, but the horns I admired became the cause of my death.</b>" <br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> All that glitters is not gold.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there lived a <b>furious lion</b> in a dense forest. It was a hot summer day, and the lion was feeling very hungry. He thought, "<b>I should drink water from the nearby river first and then search for food.</b>" <br><br>

He came out of his den and went to the river to drink water. After quenching his thirst, he began searching for food here and there. On his way, he found a small <b>hare</b>. Without any hesitation, he caught the hare. <br><br>

"<b>This hare can’t fill my stomach,</b>" thought the lion. Just as he was about to kill the hare, a <b>deer</b> ran past him. The lion became greedy. "<b>Instead of eating this small hare, let me catch the big deer. I’ll eat some now and save the rest for later.</b>" <br><br>

He let the hare go free and chased after the deer. But the deer was swift and soon vanished deep into the forest. The lion now felt sorry for letting the hare escape. <br><br>

<b>Moral of the story:</b> Greed always leads to loss.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there lived a <b>merchant</b> in a small village. He used to deal with <b>salt</b> in the market and had a donkey to carry the load. Every day, he loaded salt packs onto his donkey’s back and had to cross a stream to reach the market. <br><br>

<b>One day</b>, the donkey accidentally fell into the stream, and much of the salt dissolved in the water. The load became lighter, and the donkey easily crossed the stream. The donkey was so happy with this unexpected relief. <br><br>

On the very next day, the donkey <b>intentionally</b> fell into the stream, hoping to lighten his load again. The merchant noticed the donkey’s behavior and grew suspicious. When the donkey repeated the same trick the following day, the merchant was certain about the animal’s mischief. <br><br>

<b>The next day</b>, the merchant decided to teach the donkey a lesson. He loaded the donkey with <b>cotton</b> instead of salt. As usual, the donkey repeated his trick and fell into the stream. But this time, the cotton absorbed water and became very heavy. <br><br>

The donkey struggled under the weight and found it extremely difficult to move forward. Tired and burdened, the donkey realized his mistake. He stopped falling into the stream from that day onward and understood that playing tricks wasn’t a good idea. The merchant had successfully taught the donkey a valuable lesson. <br><br>

It was the harvesting season, so he decided to visit his field early in the morning with his friends to check the grains. <br><br>

It was a cold winter morning. As the farmer walked through his field, he saw a <b>snake</b> lying on the ground, stiff and frozen from the cold. The snake’s body was covered with many wounds. The farmer knew how <b>deadly</b> the snake could be, but his kind heart couldn’t let the creature suffer. He picked it up and placed it in his bosom to warm it back to life. <br><br>

The snake soon revived, and when it had regained enough strength, it bit the man who had shown it kindness. The bite was <b>deadly</b>, and the farmer realized he was going to die. As he drew his last breath, he turned to his friends, who were standing nearby, and said, <br><br>

<b>“Friends, learn from my fate—never take pity on a dangerous creature.”</b> <br><br>

        <item><![CDATA[There were a large number of <b>birds</b> in an aviary. They were well-protected and lived happily. <br><br>

Unluckily, an <b>infectious disease</b> broke out in the aviary, and as a result, most of the birds fell ill. <br><br>

The <b>keeper</b> became worried and went looking for a doctor. While he was inquiring about a doctor, a <b>wicked cat</b> overheard his conversation. She realized that the birds in the aviary were unwell. Sensing an opportunity, the cat started making plans to reach the aviary, knowing that once inside, she could easily kill many birds and eat them. <br><br>

Thinking hard, she decided to disguise herself as a doctor. Carrying a chest of <b>medicines</b>, she approached the aviary door and said, <br><br>

<b>“How are you, dear birds? I have come to cure you. Here are some medicines for your treatment.”</b> <br><br>

However, the birds were wise and replied, <br><br>

<b>“We are quite all right and need no nursing. Kindly leave us alone.”</b> <br><br>

In this way, the clever birds saved themselves from becoming food for the <b>wild beast</b>. <br><br>

        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there lived a <b>frog</b> in a big pond in a dense forest. In that jungle, a <b>lion</b> also lived with his family. The lion was the <b>King</b> of the forest. He ruled his kingdom without fear, and everyone was happy with his <b>majesty</b>. Sometimes, he used his powerful voice to <b>roar</b>—pleasing himself and scaring others. <br><br>

All the animals were afraid of his <b>roaring voice</b>. He also knew every corner of the forest and every animal that lived there. The pond was situated in the middle of the forest, and the lion would often drink water from it and sleep in the nearby bushes afterward. <br><br>

One day, after drinking water from the pond, the lion lay down on the grass nearby. Just as his eyes were closing, he heard a strange new <b>sound</b>. He had never heard that noise before. He opened his eyes but couldn’t see anyone. <br><br>

Then, he heard the sound again—once, twice, and a third time. The lion became scared and thought in fear, <b>"Could it be a hunter?"</b> Minutes later, a <b>frog</b> crawled out of the pond and began to <b>croak</b>. It started jumping here and there. <br><br>

The lion realized that he had been frightened by such a <b>small creature</b>. Feeling embarrassed and angry, he attacked the frog with his claws and tore it into pieces. Sadly, the poor frog died. <br><br>

One day, a <b>fox</b> heard the news and hurried to see the toad. He decided to visit early the next morning. Leaving the forest, the fox walked toward the pond where the toad lived with his family. <br><br>

After reaching the toad’s home, the fox looked him over very carefully and said, <br><br>

<b>"Mr. Toad, I heard that you are a good doctor and can cure anything! But just take a look at yourself—your blotchy skin and that rheumatic gait. If you can cure yourself first, maybe someone will believe you. Otherwise, I suggest trying a profession that suits you better."</b> <br><br>

The toad had no reply and realized that he needed to heal himself before trying to help others. <br><br>

<br><br> They kept walking until they found a <b>stream</b> and decided to take a bath. Suddenly, the friend who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning. His best friend quickly saved him.

<br><br> The other friend replied,

While crossing the bridge, the goat saw another goat coming from the opposite side. The bridge was so narrow that only one goat could cross at a time. <br><br>

The first goat said, <b>"Let me pass first."</b> <br>
The other goat replied, <b>"No, you let me pass first!"</b> <br><br>

They started threatening each other and soon got into a terrible fight. In the struggle, both goats lost their balance and fell into the stream. The other goats grazing nearby saw what happened and learned a valuable lesson from their mistake. <br><br>

A few days later, two other goats faced the same situation on the same narrow bridge. However, instead of fighting, one goat said, <br>
<b>"I’ll sit down, and you can step over me to cross safely."</b> <br><br>

The other goat agreed and replied, <b>"Thank you. Next time, I’ll do the same for you."</b> <br><br>

Both goats crossed the bridge safely and continued on their way. <br><br>

<b>"You must be mistaken,"</b> said the Old Man. <b>"I do not like fruits, so why should I steal from your orchard?"</b> <br><br>

<b>"Oh, stop it!"</b> growled the Thief. Then he thought for a moment and said, <b>"Ah! Last year, you spoke bad things about me to your neighbor."</b> <br><br>

<b>"No! That cannot be true. I did not live in this house last year,"</b> replied the Old Man. <br><br>

<b>"Well then, if it was not you, it must have been your brother,"</b> shouted the Thief. <br><br>

<b>"It cannot have been, for my brother died two years ago,"</b> answered the Old Man. <br><br>

When the Farmer entered the room, he saw the baby’s cradle turned upside down and blood everywhere. The baby was missing. <br><br>

The Farmer immediately assumed that a wild beast had killed his baby. He was overcome with sadness and anger. <br><br>

Then he noticed his <b>Dog</b> lying quietly nearby, with blood on its mouth and body. The Farmer, blinded by rage, picked up an ax and struck the Dog. The poor Dog cried out in pain and died. <br><br>

The Farmer then rushed to the overturned cradle and lifted it. To his shock, his little son was perfectly safe, sleeping peacefully! <br><br>

Nearby, a big, ugly <b>Snake</b> lay dead. <br><br>

The Farmer was stunned. He realized that his loyal Dog had fought and killed the Snake to save his baby. Happiness for his child’s safety was overshadowed by the sorrow of having killed his faithful companion without thinking. Sadly, he picked up his baby, full of regret. <br><br>

The Ape looked up and saw, high above him, a <b>hive</b>. He also noticed that the <b>Bees</b> were buzzing and working together to make honey. <br><br>

The Ape wished he could climb up, break off a piece of the hive, chew it, and enjoy the fresh honey! But he did not move at all. He sadly remembered, "<i>Just last week, I tried to steal honey from the hive, and the angry Bees stung me! It was so painful!</i>" <br><br>

The Ape sighed. <br><br>

A <b>Bee</b>, flying up to the hive, noticed him. The Ape asked the Bee, "<i>How are you able to make such a sweet, wonderful liquid like honey and, at the same time, carry such a horribly painful sting?</i>" <br><br>

The Young Girl’s father took her small hand in his own large one and said, "<i>The poor Hens think you have come to harm them or their little children. So they are scared of you and bite in fear.

The <b>Ant</b> replied, "<i>Don’t be so proud! You are always hated when you enter the temples. You are driven away as soon as you sit on the King’s crown or the Queen’s forehead. You have nothing saved for difficult times because you are lazy. In winter, you feed yourself on a pile of cow dung. Look at me! I work hard and gather a store of grain for the winter.

One day, <b>Hindbad</b> was carrying a big load on his head. Suddenly, it began to rain heavily, and <b>Hindbad</b> rushed to a nearby house to take shelter. It was a sprawling, beautiful house. <b>Hindbad</b> sat in a shed and waited for the rain to stop. While sitting there, he was enchanted by the soft, melodious music and the rich, soothing fragrance of perfume coming from inside. <br><br>

The beautiful house and its visible luxury caused a tinge of sadness in the heart of the poor porter. He exclaimed loudly, "<i>Why am I poor, and why do I lead such a hard life, while others live in wealth and comfort? Why is there such a discrepancy? Am I not a good person?</i>" <br><br>

The owner of the house, whose name was <b>Sindbad</b>, overheard the poor porter’s disappointed words. He immediately sent his servant to invite <b>Hindbad</b> inside. When the porter entered, <b>Sindbad</b> welcomed him warmly and offered him a seat with a kind smile. <br><br>

The house was even more luxurious inside. <b>Sindbad</b> offered a rich meal to the poor porter. After the meal, <b>Sindbad</b> asked kindly, "<i>Now tell me, why were you expressing resentment at your fate?</i>" <br><br>

"<i>Sir, when I saw your splendid life, I felt dejected. My poor fate annoyed me, and I couldn’t help but express my frustration,</i>" said <b>Hindbad</b>. <br><br>

<b>Sindbad</b> responded, "<i>You have every right to feel this way at the moment. However, let me share the story of my adventurous life—the dangers I faced and the risks I took to earn this wealth.</i>" <br><br>

<b>Sindbad</b> then narrated to <b>Hindbad</b> the many adventures he had undertaken and the perils he had faced to gather his enormous wealth. <br><br>

        <item><![CDATA[There was a poor fisherman who had a wife and three children. He made his living by casting his net into the sea, following a personal rule to cast his net only <b>four times a day</b> and never exceeding this limit. <br><br>

One day, the fisherman went about his daily work. He threw his net into the seawater, and when he tried to pull it out, he couldn’t lift it. Overjoyed, he thought, "<i>Surely, I’ve caught a big fish!</i>" Removing his shirt, he dove into the sea and pulled out the net with great effort. However, his joy quickly turned to disappointment—it was not a fish but a <b>dead jackass</b> that had torn his net. The fisherman exclaimed in grief, "<i>It seems there’s no justice left in the world of Allah!</i>" <br><br>

Overcoming his disappointment, he cast his net again in the name of Allah. This time, the net felt even heavier, raising his hopes for a large catch. Yet again, when he pulled it up, his heart sank—it contained nothing but a <b>mud-filled pitcher</b>. <br><br>

Still determined, he cast his net for the <b>third time</b>. Sadly, he found only <b>broken glass pieces and potsherds</b> tangled in his net. His sorrow deepened. Raising his eyes to heaven, he pleaded, "<i>O Allah, I have thrown my net three times and received nothing. Please grant me at least something for my daily bread.</i>" <br><br>

On his <b>fourth attempt</b>, the net felt impossibly heavy. Frustrated and filled with despair, he cried out, "<i>In the court of Allah, is there no justice left?</i>" After much effort, he brought up the net and discovered a <b>cucumber-shaped brass jar</b> sealed with a <b>lead cap</b> bearing the mark of <b>Lord Sulayman</b>, the son of David. <br><br>

The fisherman was overjoyed and thought, "<i>If I sell this jar in the brass market, it will fetch me at least ten gold dinars.</i>" Before selling it, however, curiosity took over. He decided to open the jar. After prying it open, he found it empty—at least at first glance. Suddenly, a thick <b>vapor</b> spiraled out of the jar, rising toward the sky and transforming into a monstrous <b>Ifrit</b>. The enormous figure’s head touched the clouds while his feet stood firm on the ground. His eyes glowed like lamps, his mouth was like a vast cave, and his hands were like pitchforks. <br><br>

Terrified, the fisherman froze as the Ifrit roared, "<i>Sulayman, spare me! I will never oppose you again!</i>" The fisherman cautiously replied, "<i>O Ifrit, Sulayman has been dead for over 1,800 years! Tell me your story—why were you trapped inside this jar?</i>" <br><br>

The Ifrit responded, "<i>O Fisherman, there is only one God, and now, prepare for death.</i>" Shocked, the fisherman asked, "<i>Why would you kill me when I freed you?</i>" The Ifrit explained that long ago, he had rebelled against Sulayman and was sealed inside the jar as punishment. Initially, he vowed to reward whoever freed him, but after centuries of being ignored, his gratitude turned into rage. Now, he vowed to kill whoever released him—allowing them only to choose how they would die. <br><br>

Thinking quickly, the fisherman said, "<i>Before you kill me, I must know—how could someone as large as you fit inside such a small jar?</i>" The Ifrit laughed and transformed back into vapor, squeezing himself inside the jar to prove his power. The moment the last wisp of vapor entered, the fisherman swiftly sealed the jar. <br><br>

Trapped again, the Ifrit pleaded for freedom, promising riches and rewards. But the fisherman replied, "<i>You’re a liar! I will throw you back into the sea where you’ll remain until Judgment Day.</i>" <br><br>

The Ifrit, desperate, said, "<i>Let me go, and I will make you wealthy beyond your dreams.</i>" But the fisherman wisely answered, "<i>My situation with you is just like the story of the Wazir of King Yuman and the Sage Duban.</i>" <br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> <i>Wisdom and intelligence are mightier than brute strength. Stay calm in the face of danger, and use your wits to outsmart even the most powerful foe.</i>

One day, while working in the forest, Ali Baba overhears a group of <b>forty thieves</b> visiting their treasure store. The treasure is hidden inside a cave, sealed by magic. It opens with the words <b>“Open, Simsim”</b> and seals shut with the command <b>“Close, Simsim”</b>. After the thieves leave, Ali Baba enters the cave and takes some treasure home.<br><br>

Ali Baba borrows his sister-in-law’s <b>scales</b> to weigh the gold coins. Curious, she places a blob of wax on the scales to discover what Ali Baba is measuring. To her shock, a gold coin sticks to the wax. She tells Cassim, Ali Baba’s rich and greedy brother. Under pressure, Ali Baba reveals the secret of the cave.<br><br>

Cassim, driven by greed, goes to the cave, enters with the magic words, but forgets the words needed to exit. The thieves find him inside and kill him. When Cassim doesn’t return, Ali Baba finds his brother’s <b>quartered</b> body at the cave entrance, meant to warn others.<br><br>

Ali Baba brings the body home and entrusts <b>Morgiana</b>, a clever slave girl from Cassim’s household, with covering up the true cause of Cassim’s death. She buys <b>medicines</b> to create the illusion of a long illness and hires a blindfolded tailor, <b>Baba Mustafa</b>, to sew the body back together. Cassim is given a proper burial without suspicion.<br><br>

The thieves, realizing someone else knows their secret, track the trail to the town. One thief questions Baba Mustafa, who unknowingly leads them to Ali Baba’s house while blindfolded. The thief marks the door for a planned attack, but Morgiana outwits him by marking all nearby houses similarly. When the thieves return, they cannot identify the house, and the leader kills the failed thief.<br><br>

Another thief tries again, this time chipping a stone from Ali Baba’s doorstep. Morgiana spots this and replicates the damage on all the nearby houses. Again, the thief fails and is killed.<br><br>

Finally, the leader of the thieves investigates himself and memorizes the house’s details. Pretending to be an <b>oil merchant</b>, he brings <b>thirty-eight oil jars</b>—one filled with oil, and the rest hiding his men. While Ali Baba sleeps, Morgiana discovers the plot and pours <b>boiling oil</b> into each jar, killing the thieves. The leader escapes upon discovering his men are dead.<br><br>

Later, the leader befriends Ali Baba’s son under the guise of being a merchant and is invited to dinner. Morgiana recognizes him and, during a celebratory <b>dagger dance</b>, stabs him in the heart. Initially angry, Ali Baba later rewards Morgiana with her <b>freedom</b> and marries her to his son.<br><br>

Ali Baba remains the only one who knows the secret of the cave’s treasure. Thus, the story ends happily for everyone except the <b>forty thieves</b> and the greedy <b>Cassim</b>.<br><br>

He was greatly pleased to stop at this place, for the agreeable smell of <b>aloeswood</b> and <b>pastels</b> mixed with the scent of <b>rose-water</b>, completely perfuming and embalming the air. Inside, he heard a beautiful <b>concert of instrumental music</b>, accompanied by the harmonious notes of <b>nightingales</b> and other birds. This delightful melody, along with the smell of various savory dishes, made the porter conclude that there was a grand feast and much rejoicing inside.<br><br>

He approached some of the servants, who were dressed in <b>magnificent apparel</b>, and asked about the owner of the house. One of them replied, <br><br> <b>"Do you live in Baghdad and not know that this is the house of <b>Sindbad the Sailor</b>, the famous voyager who has sailed around the world?"</b><br><br>

The porter lifted his eyes to the heavens and said loudly, <br><br> <b>"Almighty Creator of all things, consider the difference between Sindbad and me! Every day, I am exposed to fatigue and hardship, and I can scarcely earn coarse barley bread for myself and my family. Yet, fortunate Sindbad spends immense riches and leads a life of continual pleasure. What has he done to deserve such blessings, and what have I done to deserve such misery?"</b><br><br>

While the porter was lost in his melancholy thoughts, a servant came out of the house and, taking him by the arm, asked him to follow, for <b>Sindbad</b> wished to speak with him. The servant led him into a grand hall, where a number of people sat around a table covered with all sorts of <b>savory dishes</b>. At the upper end of the table sat a <b>comely, venerable gentleman</b> with a long white beard. Behind him stood several officers and servants, ready to attend to his needs. This gentleman was <b>Sindbad</b> himself.<br><br>

Hindbad, the porter, became even more fearful at the sight of so many people and such a grand feast. Trembling, he saluted the company. <b>Sindbad</b> kindly invited him to sit at his right hand, served him personally, and offered him some excellent <b>wine</b> from the sideboard.<br><br>

Now, <b>Sindbad</b> had overheard the porter’s complaint through the window, and this was why he had him brought inside. After the feast, <b>Sindbad</b> addressed him:<br><br> <b>"What is your name, and what is your occupation? I would like to hear from your own mouth what you said in the street."</b><br><br>

Hindbad lowered his head in shame and replied, <br><br> <b>"My lord, I confess that my fatigue put me in a bad mood, and I uttered some indiscreet words. I beg your pardon."</b><br><br>

<b>"Do not think I am so unjust as to be offended by your complaint,"</b> resumed <b>Sindbad</b>. <b>"But I must correct your misconception about me.

        <item><![CDATA[<b>Aladdin</b> was the son of a poor tailor in an Eastern city. He was a spoiled boy who loved play more than work. When <b>Mustapha</b>, his father, died, Aladdin was unable to earn a living, and his poor mother had to spin cotton all day to buy food for their support. Still, she dearly loved her son, believing that he had a good heart and would eventually become a worthy and prosperous man.<br><br>

One day, as Aladdin was walking outside the town, an old man approached him and, after studying his face, claimed to be his father’s brother. The man said he had been away in a distant country but now wished to help his nephew succeed. He placed a ring on Aladdin’s finger, assuring him that no harm would come as long as he wore it. In truth, this man was no relative but a wicked magician who planned to use Aladdin for his own purposes.<br><br>

The old man led Aladdin deep into the countryside, stopping at a lonely spot between two high black mountains. There, he lit a fire, threw in some gum, and chanted strange words. The ground opened before them, revealing a hidden stone trapdoor. The magician instructed Aladdin to descend the broken steps below and described what he would find: three halls and, beyond them, a garden full of beautiful trees. At the end, on a terrace, there was a shelf with a lighted lamp. Aladdin was told to take the lamp, extinguish it, pour out the oil, and bring it back.<br><br>

Aladdin followed the instructions carefully, making sure not to touch the walls as he passed through the halls. He retrieved the lamp, emptied the oil, and wrapped it in his arms. As he returned through the garden, he noticed the bright, glass-like fruits on the trees. Entranced, he picked many and stuffed them into his pockets before calling out to the magician for help getting back up the steps.<br><br>

<b>"Give me the lamp,"</b> demanded the old man angrily.<br><br>

<b>"Not until I’m safely out,"</b> replied Aladdin.<br><br>

Enraged, the magician slammed down the trapdoor, leaving Aladdin trapped. In despair, Aladdin rubbed the ring by chance, and suddenly a figure appeared before him, saying, <br><br> <b>"I am the Genius of the Ring. What do you desire?"</b><br><br>

Aladdin asked to be freed and returned home. Instantly, he found himself back with his mother, who was overjoyed to see him. When they examined the lamp, his mother began rubbing it to make it shine. To their amazement, another figure appeared—<b>the Genius of the Lamp</b>—who granted their wish for food. A servant arrived with a delicious feast on a silver dish, with silver plates for them to eat from.<br><br>

They lived happily for weeks, selling the silverware for money. Aladdin, now better dressed, eventually saw the <b>Sultan’s daughter</b> while she was returning from the baths. Struck by her beauty, he fell in love instantly and asked his mother to approach the Sultan and request the Princess’s hand in marriage.<br><br>

Though his mother thought the idea foolish, Aladdin knew the value of the magical lamp and the jewels—disguised as colored glass—that he had collected from the garden. He sent a bowl full of these treasures to the Sultan, who was amazed by their richness. The Sultan agreed to the marriage on the condition that Aladdin send <b>forty bowls</b> of jewels carried by twenty white and twenty black attendants, all dressed handsomely.<br><br>

With the Genius of the Lamp’s help, Aladdin fulfilled the Sultan’s demand. Overjoyed, the Sultan allowed his daughter, <b>Princess Bulbul</b>, to marry Aladdin. Using the lamp’s magic, Aladdin built a splendid palace overnight and lived happily with his bride for some time.<br><br>

However, the wicked magician returned, determined to steal the lamp. Disguised as a merchant, he cried out in the streets, <br><br> <b>"New lamps for old ones!"</b><br><br>

A careless maid exchanged Aladdin’s old lamp for a shiny new one, unaware of its magical power. The magician quickly used the lamp to transport the palace—and Princess Bulbul—to Africa.<br><br>

Aladdin was devastated, and the Sultan was furious, threatening Aladdin’s life if he didn’t return the Princess in three days. Aladdin called upon the Genius of the Ring, who transported him to Africa. Reunited with Bulbul, Aladdin devised a plan to recover the lamp. He gave Bulbul a powerful sleeping potion and told her to offer it to the magician during dinner.<br><br>

The magician drank the potion and fell into a deep sleep. Aladdin then took the lamp from his arms and summoned the Genius to return the palace, the Princess, and himself back to their home city.<br><br>

The Sultan was overjoyed at their return, and Aladdin and Bulbul lived happily ever after, enjoying their wealth and good fortune for many years to come.<br><br>]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>He That Seeks Shall Find</b><br><br>

<b>"He that seeks shall find, and to him that knocks shall be opened,"</b> says an old Arab proverb.<br><br>

<b>"I will try that,"</b> said a youth one day. Determined to test the truth of the saying, he journeyed to <b>Bagdad</b> and presented himself before the <b>Vizier</b>, a high-ranking minister.<br><br>

<b>"My lord,"</b> said the youth, <b>"for many years I have lived a quiet and solitary life, the boredom of which now wearies me. I have never allowed myself to desire anything. But as my teacher often told me, 'He that seeks shall find, and to him that knocks shall be opened,' I have now resolved to pursue a single wish: I want to marry the Caliph’s daughter."</b><br><br>

The Vizier thought the poor young man was mad and dismissed him, telling him to return some other time.<br><br>

Undeterred, the youth came back day after day, never discouraged by the repeated refusals. One day, as the youth was making his plea, the <b>Caliph</b> himself overheard the strange request. Full of astonishment, the Caliph listened carefully. Rather than ordering the young man’s execution—as many rulers might—he was amused and decided to have some fun.<br><br>

<b>"For the great, the wise, or the brave, to request my daughter’s hand is a reasonable demand,"</b> said the Caliph. <b>"But what claims do you have? If you wish to marry my daughter, you must prove yourself by a great act of bravery or wisdom. Ages ago, a gemstone of priceless value was lost in the depths of the Tigris River. Whoever retrieves it shall win her hand."</b><br><br>

Satisfied with the challenge, the youth set out for the Tigris. Each morning, he rowed a small boat to the river’s center, scooping up water and throwing it onto the land. After hours of this effort, he would kneel down and pray. His persistence soon caused unease among the river’s fish.<br><br>

Fearing that the young man might eventually drain the entire river, the fish gathered for a great assembly.<br><br>

<b>"What is the purpose of this man?"</b> asked the king of the fishes.<br><br>

<b>"He seeks the gemstone buried at the bottom of the Tigris,"</b> replied one of the fish.<br><br>

<b>"Then I advise you to give it up,"</b> said the wise old fish king. <b>"If he has the will and determination to persist, he will drain every drop from the river rather than abandon his quest."</b><br><br>

Out of fear and respect for his unwavering resolve, the fish retrieved the gemstone from the riverbed and placed it in the young man’s vessel.<br><br>

The youth returned triumphantly to Bagdad, presenting the gemstone to the Caliph. True to his promise, the Caliph rewarded the young man by granting him the hand of his daughter in marriage.<br><br>

And so, through unwavering persistence and determination, the youth’s dream came true, fulfilling the ancient proverb: <b>"He that seeks shall find, and to him that knocks shall be opened."</b><br><br>]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Caliph Charid, ruler of Bagdad, reclined on his couch one pleasant afternoon, smoking his long pipe and sipping coffee from a fine dish held by a slave. His Grand Vizier, Mansor, entered and informed him of a peddler in the court below whose wares might interest him. In good spirits, the Caliph summoned the peddler, who eagerly displayed his treasures: pearls, rings, silks, and many other riches.<br><br>

The Caliph selected something for himself, a handsome gift for the Vizier, and another for the Vizier’s wife. Just as the peddler was packing his goods, the Caliph noticed a small drawer and asked what it contained.<br><br>

<b>"Only something of no value, which I picked up in a street of Mecca,"</b> the peddler replied. He opened the drawer, revealing a small box with black powder and a scroll written in characters unknown to either the Caliph or the Vizier.<br><br>

Intrigued, the Caliph bought the box and asked his Vizier to find someone who could decipher the scroll. Near the mosque lived Selim, a man known for his vast knowledge of languages. When Selim arrived, the Caliph said:<br><br>

<b>"If you can read what is written here, I shall reward you with a robe of honor. Fail, and you will be punished for your false reputation."</b><br><br>

Selim bowed, studied the scroll, and soon exclaimed:<br><br>

<b>"My lord, I hope to die if this is not written in Latin!"</b><br><br>

<b>"Then read it,"</b> the Caliph commanded impatiently.<br><br>

Selim translated:<br><br>

<b>"Let him who finds this box praise Allah. If he snuffs the powder and utters the word ‘Matabor,’ he shall transform into any creature he desires and understand the language of animals. To return to human form, bow thrice to the east and repeat ‘Matabor.’ But beware: should he laugh while transformed, the magic word will be forgotten, and he will remain enchanted forever."</b><br><br>

Delighted, the Caliph rewarded Selim generously and kept the discovery secret. The next morning, the Caliph and his Vizier ventured to a large pond beyond the city, where storks were often seen. Eager to hear the birds’ conversations, they each took a pinch of the powder, cried <b>"Matabor!"</b> and instantly transformed into storks.<br><br>

<b>"By the beard of the Prophet—though I have none now!"</b> the Caliph exclaimed, astonished by his transformation.<br><br>

<b>"You look just as dignified as ever, my lord,"</b> the Vizier chuckled.<br><br>

They soon overheard two storks conversing. One stork offered frog legs for breakfast, while the other declined, saying she had to practice dancing. Watching her comical movements, the Caliph and Vizier burst into laughter. Instantly, they realized they had forgotten the magic word.<br><br>

Desperate to reverse the enchantment, they wandered as storks, surviving on fruit. Flying over Bagdad, they saw a grand procession welcoming a new ruler—Mirza, the son of Kaschnur, their greatest enemy.<br><br>

The Caliph realized their misfortune was Kaschnur’s doing and decided to fly to the sacred city of Medina for divine help. Exhausted, they took refuge in a ruined castle, where they encountered a sorrowful screech owl who, to their surprise, spoke Arabic.<br><br>

The owl revealed herself as <b>Tusa</b>, the daughter of the King of the Indies, cursed by Kaschnur for refusing his son’s marriage proposal. She explained that the magicians gathered monthly at the castle, and if the Caliph and Vizier listened closely, they might hear the forgotten magic word.<br><br>

That night, hidden near the hall, they overheard Kaschnur boasting about transforming the Caliph into a stork and repeating the magic word—<b>"Matabor."</b> They hurried outside, faced the rising sun, bowed thrice, and cried, <b>"Matabor!"</b> Instantly, they regained their human forms.<br><br>

In gratitude, the Caliph proposed marriage to Tusa, breaking her curse and restoring her beauty.<br><br>

They returned to Bagdad, where the people rejoiced at the Caliph’s return. Kaschnur was imprisoned, and his son, Mirza, was given a choice: exile or the black powder. Choosing the powder, Mirza was turned into a stork and kept in the palace gardens.<br><br>

The Caliph married the beautiful Princess Tusa, and together with Mansor, they often laughed over their enchanted adventure. The Caliph would even amuse his children by imitating the Vizier’s awkward stork movements, while Mansor stroked his long beard with a knowing smile.<br><br>]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>My father</b> was a <b>rich merchant</b>. He bequeathed me a large estate, which I wasted in riotous living. I quickly perceived that I was misspending my time, which is, of all things, the most valuable. I remembered the saying of the great <b>Solomon</b>, which I had frequently heard from my father: <b>"A good name is better than precious ointment"</b>; and again, <b>"Wisdom is good with an inheritance."</b> I resolved to walk in my father’s ways, and I entered into a contract with some merchants and embarked with them on board a ship we had fitted out in partnership.

<br><br>

We set sail and steered our course toward the Indies, through the <b>Persian Gulf</b>. At first, I was troubled with sea sickness but quickly recovered my health. During our voyage, we touched at several islands, where we sold or exchanged our goods.

<br><br>

One day, we were becalmed near a small island, little elevated above the level of the water and resembling a green meadow. The captain ordered the sails to be furled and allowed those who wished to land. While we were enjoying ourselves—eating, drinking, and recovering from the fatigue of the sea—the island suddenly trembled and shook terribly.

<br><br>

The trembling was noticed aboard the ship, and we were called to re-embark speedily, lest we all be lost. What we had mistaken for an island was actually the back of a giant <b>sea monster</b>.

<br><br>

The nimblest passengers reached the sloop, others swam toward safety; but I remained on the “island” when it disappeared into the sea. I had only enough time to grab hold of a piece of wood brought from the ship to make a fire. Meanwhile, the captain, having rescued those who swam and those in the sloop, took advantage of the favorable wind, hoisted his sails, and continued the voyage.

<br><br>

I was left at the mercy of the waves for the rest of the day and the following night. Just as my strength was failing and I had lost all hope of survival, a wave mercifully threw me onto an island. The bank was high and rugged, but I managed to climb up using tree roots within reach.

<br><br>

When the sun rose, I was very weak. I found some edible herbs and luckily discovered a spring of excellent water. Advancing further inland, I reached a fine plain where I noticed some horses grazing. As I approached them, a man’s voice called out, asking who I was. I shared my misfortune with him, and he kindly took me by the hand and led me into a cave, where other people were equally surprised to see me.

<br><br>

I partook of the provisions they offered and asked why they were in such a deserted place. They explained that they were grooms of the island’s king, bringing his horses there every year for pasturage. They were to return home the next day, and had I arrived a day later, I would have perished, for the inhabited part of the island was a great distance away.

<br><br>

The next morning, we traveled to the capital of the island, where I was presented to the king. He questioned me about my journey and, upon hearing my story, ensured I lacked for nothing.

<br><br>

Being a merchant, I associated with others of my trade, particularly strangers, hoping for news from <b>Bagdad</b> or a chance to return home. The Maharaja’s capital was located by the sea, with a fine harbor that welcomed ships from around the world. I also enjoyed the company of learned <b>Indians</b> and took pleasure in their discussions.

<br><br>

I soon heard about an island named <b>Cassel</b>, said to be haunted by drum sounds every night. Mariners believed it to be the dwelling place of spirits. Determined to explore it, I set out and encountered fishes 100 to 200 cubits long. Though fearsome in appearance, they were timid and fled at the noise of two sticks being struck together. I also saw fish a cubit long with heads resembling owls.

<br><br>

One day, at the port, I recognized the ship on which I had first embarked from <b>Bussorah</b>. I approached the captain and asked for my goods, saying, "I am <b>Sindbad</b>, and those bales marked with his name are mine."

<br><br>

The captain, shocked, exclaimed, <b>"Heavens! I saw Sindbad perish with my own eyes!"</b> I persuaded him to listen to my story. Soon, people from his ship recognized me, expressing great joy at seeing me alive. Eventually, the captain himself embraced me, praising <b>Heaven</b> for my survival and returning my goods.

<br><br>

I selected the most valuable items and presented them to the Maharaja, who, pleased with my fortune, gifted me something even more precious in return. I then boarded the same ship, trading my goods for spices like <b>aloeswood, sandalwood, camphor, nutmeg, cloves, pepper</b>, and <b>ginger</b>. We visited several islands before finally arriving in <b>Bussorah</b> and, from there, returning home with goods worth <b>100,000 sequins</b>.

<br><br>

Sindbad ended his tale and ordered the musicians to resume their concert. In the evening, he sent for a purse containing <b>100 sequins</b> and gave it to the porter, saying, <b>"Take this, Hindbad, and return tomorrow to hear more of my adventures."</b>

<br><br>

The porter went away, astonished by Sindbad’s generosity. The story delighted his wife and children, who gave thanks for the blessings provided through <b>Sindbad’s</b> hand.

<br><br>

The next day, <b>Hindbad</b> donned his finest robe and returned to the generous traveler. Sindbad welcomed him warmly. After dinner, Sindbad addressed his guests:

<br><br>

<b>"Gentlemen, please listen to the adventures of my second voyage. They deserve your attention even more than those of the first."</b>

<br><br>
 ]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>I designed</b>, after my first voyage, to spend the rest of my days at <b>Bagdad</b>. However, it was not long before I grew weary of an indolent life. I soon resolved to put to sea a <b>second time</b>, accompanied by merchants of known probity. We embarked on a good ship and, after recommending ourselves to <b>God</b>, set sail. We traded from island to island, exchanging commodities with great profit.

<br><br>

One day, we landed on an island covered with various fruit trees, but we could see neither man nor animal. We walked through the meadows and along the streams that watered them. While some gathered flowers and fruits, I took my wine and provisions and sat down near a stream between two tall trees, which formed a thick shade. After a hearty meal, I fell asleep.

<br><br>

I cannot tell how long I slept, but when I awoke, the ship was gone.

<br><br>

In this <b>sad condition</b>, I was ready to die of grief. I cried out in agony, beat my head and chest, and threw myself on the ground in despair. I reproached myself for not being content with the wealth from my first voyage, which could have sustained me for a lifetime. But it was too late for regrets. At last, I resigned myself to the will of <b>God</b>.

<br><br>

Not knowing what to do, I climbed a lofty tree to see if I could spot anything that offered hope. When I gazed toward the sea, I saw nothing but sky and water. However, looking over the land, I noticed something white in the distance. I took what provisions I had left and made my way toward it.

<br><br>

As I approached, I realized it was a white dome of <b>prodigious height</b> and extent. Upon closer inspection, I found it to be very smooth and without any opening or way to climb up, as it was too tall and sleek. It measured at least fifty paces around.

<br><br>

By this time, the sun was setting, and suddenly, the sky darkened as if covered by a thick cloud. To my astonishment, this darkness was caused by a monstrous bird flying toward me. I remembered hearing sailors speak of a miraculous bird called the <b>roc</b>, and I now understood that the great dome was its egg.

<br><br>

As the bird settled over the egg, I quickly tied myself to one of its legs with my turban, hoping that the roc would carry me away from the deserted island. At daybreak, the bird took flight, rising so high that I could no longer see the earth. Eventually, it descended rapidly, causing me to lose consciousness.

<br><br>

When I regained my senses, I quickly untied myself and found that the roc had left me in a valley surrounded by towering mountains, seemingly reaching the clouds—steep and impossible to climb.

<br><br>

As I walked through the valley, I noticed the ground was covered with <b>diamonds</b> of surprising size. However, my joy was soon replaced by terror when I saw monstrous serpents, large enough to swallow elephants, lurking nearby. They retreated to their dens during the day, hiding from their enemy, the roc, and emerged only at night.

<br><br>

At night, I took refuge in a cave, securing the entrance with a large stone to shield myself from the serpents. Though I was safe, their hissing outside the cave deprived me of sleep.

<br><br>

The next day, I noticed large pieces of raw meat falling into the valley. I recalled hearing tales from sailors about merchants who used this method to retrieve diamonds—throwing meat into the valley so that the diamonds stuck to it. The eagles would then carry the meat (with diamonds attached) back to their nests, where the merchants retrieved the precious stones.

<br><br>

I devised a plan for my escape. I gathered the largest diamonds I could find, tied them into my leather bag, secured a piece of meat around myself with my turban, and lay face-down on the ground. Soon, an eagle swooped down, carried me away, and dropped me into its nest.

<br><br>

The merchants, hearing the eagle’s cries, frightened it away and were astonished to find me alive in the nest. I shared my story and offered them diamonds in return for their help. One merchant, amazed by the size of my gems, accepted only a small share, saying it was enough to make him wealthy for life.

<br><br>

I stayed with the merchants that night and told my story again for those who had not heard it. The next morning, we left the valley and traveled near mountains inhabited by enormous serpents, which we fortunately avoided.

<br><br>

We eventually reached a port and sailed to the isle of <b>Roha</b>, famous for its camphor trees. These trees were so large that a hundred men could sit comfortably under their shade. The island was also home to <b>rhinoceroses</b>, large beasts with a single horn on their noses, known to fight elephants.

<br><br>

I traded some of my diamonds for merchandise and traveled through other islands until we finally reached <b>Bussorah</b>. From there, I returned to <b>Bagdad</b>, gave generous alms to the poor, and lived honorably on the riches I had gained through such perilous adventures.

<br><br>

Thus <b>Sindbad</b> ended the tale of his second voyage. He gifted <b>Hindbad</b> another hundred sequins and invited him to return the next day to hear the account of his <b>third voyage</b>.

<br><br>
<b>Moral of the Story:</b>

The tale teaches us that greed and curiosity can lead to dangerous situations, but courage, quick thinking, and perseverance can help us overcome even the most perilous challenges. It also reminds us that true wealth lies in resilience and the generosity we extend to others.

        <item><![CDATA[I soon again grew weary of living a life of idleness and, hardening myself against the thought of any danger, I embarked with some merchants on another long voyage. We touched at several ports, where we traded. One day, we were overtaken by a dreadful tempest, which drove us from our course. <br><br>

The storm continued for several days and brought us before the port of an island, which the captain was very <b>unwilling</b> to enter, but we were obliged to cast anchor. When we had furled our sails, the captain told us that this and some other neighboring islands were inhabited by hairy savages, who would speedily attack us; and though they were but dwarfs, yet we must make no resistance, for they were more in number than the <b>locusts</b>. If we happened to kill one, they would all fall upon us and destroy us. <br><br>

We soon found that what the captain had told us was all too true. An innumerable multitude of frightful savages, about two feet high, covered all over with red hair, came swimming toward us and encompassed our ship. They chattered as they came near, but we understood not their language. They climbed up the sides of the ship with such agility that it surprised us. They took down our sails, cut the cable, and, hauling us to the shore, made us all get out, and afterward carried the ship into another island, whence they had come. <br><br>

As we advanced, we perceived at a distance a vast pile of buildings and made toward it. We found it to be a palace, elegantly built and very lofty, with a gate of ebony consisting of two leaves, which we opened. We saw before us a large apartment with a porch. On one side, there was a heap of human bones, and on the other, a vast number of roasting spits. We trembled at this spectacle and were seized with deadly apprehension when suddenly the gate of the apartment opened with a loud crash, and there came out the horrible figure of a <b>black giant</b>, as tall as a lofty palm tree. <br><br>

He had but one eye, and that in the middle of his forehead, where it blazed bright as a lump of burning coal. His foreteeth were very long and sharp and stood out from his mouth, which was as deep as that of a horse. His upper lip hung down upon his breast. His ears resembled those of an elephant and covered his shoulders, and his nails were as long and crooked as the talons of the greatest birds. <br><br>

At the sight of so frightful a creature, we became insensible and lay like dead men. <br><br>

At last, we came to ourselves and saw him sitting on the porch, looking at us. When he had considered us well, he advanced toward us and, laying his hand upon me, took me up by the nape of my neck, turning me around as a butcher would a sheep’s head. After examining me and perceiving that I was so lean that I had nothing but skin and bone, he let me go. He took up all the rest one by one and viewed them in the same manner. The captain, being the fattest, was seized by him, thrust through with a spit, roasted, and eaten for his supper. Having finished his meal, he returned to his porch, where he lay down and snored louder than thunder until morning. <br><br>

The next night, we determined to take our revenge. After the giant had finished his inhuman supper on another of our seamen, he lay down and fell asleep. As soon as he began to snore, nine of the boldest among us, including myself, took spits and, after heating the points in the fire, thrust them into his eye all at once, blinding him. The pain made him break out into a frightful yell. He started up and stretched out his hands to catch us, but we ran to places beyond his reach. <br><br>

We immediately fled the palace and reached the shore, where we made rafts from the timber lying around. As soon as the sun rose, we took to the sea. However, the giant, now accompanied by two others, appeared on the shore. They threw huge stones with such accuracy that they sank all the rafts except the one I was on. All my companions perished, and only two survived with me. <br><br>

After days adrift at sea, we were thrown upon another island, where we found excellent fruit to restore our strength. Yet danger found us again. A monstrous serpent swallowed one of my comrades and later devoured the other, despite our attempts to escape by climbing a tall tree. <br><br>

Left alone, I built a barrier of wood and thorns around myself. That night, the serpent returned but could not breach my fort. The next day, just as despair overcame me, a ship passed by. I signaled for help, and the crew rescued me. To my surprise, the captain was the same man who had left me behind on a previous voyage. Recognizing me, he returned my preserved goods and welcomed me aboard. <br><br>

After trading in several islands, I returned to Baghdad, wealthier than ever. I gave generously to the poor and bought more land. <br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b><br> Perseverance and courage in the face of danger can lead to survival and success. Even in the darkest times, hope and faith can bring unexpected salvation.
 ]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[After I had rested from the dangers of my <b>third voyage</b>, my passion for trade and love of novelty soon prevailed again. I, therefore, settled my affairs and prepared a stock of goods suitable for the traffic I intended to engage in. I took the route of <b>Persia</b>, traveled across several provinces, and eventually arrived at a port where I embarked.

<br><br>

On setting out to sea, we were overtaken by a sudden gust of wind that forced the captain to lower the sails and take necessary precautions to prevent disaster. But all was in vain; our efforts were ineffective—the sails were torn to pieces, and the ship was stranded. Many merchants and sailors drowned, and the cargo was lost.

<br><br>

I was fortunate, along with several merchants and sailors, to grab onto some planks and was carried by the current to an island nearby. There, we found fruit and spring water, which preserved our lives. We stayed overnight near the shore where we had been cast.

<br><br>

The next morning, at sunrise, we explored the island and found some houses. As we approached, we were surrounded by a large number of <b>negroes</b> who seized us and divided us among themselves, taking us to their homes. I and five of my comrades were taken to one place. There, they made us sit down and gave us a certain herb, making signs for us to eat it. My comrades, unaware that the locals were not eating it themselves, consumed it greedily. Suspecting a trick, I refused to taste it—this decision saved me.

<br><br>

Soon, my companions lost their senses, speaking incoherently. The locals fed us rice prepared with <b>coconut oil</b>, and while my comrades ate greedily, I partook only sparingly. The herb had been meant to dull our senses and fatten us for consumption, as these people were <b>cannibals</b>. They eventually devoured my companions. I, however, grew leaner due to my constant fear of death. My sickly appearance spared me from being eaten.

<br><br>

I eventually seized an opportunity to escape, traveling for seven days, surviving on coconuts. On the eighth day, I reached the sea and encountered white people gathering pepper. They spoke Arabic, and I explained my misfortune to them. Amazed by my escape, they took me to their island and presented me to their kind king, who generously clothed me and ensured my well-being.

<br><br>

I gained great favor at the king’s court. Noticing that the locals rode horses without bridles or stirrups, I crafted a saddle, bit, and stirrups. When I presented them to the king, he was so pleased that he showered me with gifts. My reputation grew as I made similar offerings to the ministers and nobles.

<br><br>

One day, the king expressed his affection for me and insisted that I marry a noble lady of his court. I agreed reluctantly. Although my wife and I lived in harmony, I still longed to return to <b>Baghdad</b>.

<br><br>

A tragic custom on the island dictated that when one spouse died, the other would be buried alive with them. When my wife fell ill and died, I pleaded with the king to spare me from this fate, but my appeals were in vain. I was lowered into a deep pit with provisions, as per the custom.

<br><br>

In the pit, I survived on the limited food until I heard breathing nearby. Following the sound, I discovered a hole in the rock leading to the seashore. I escaped and signaled a passing ship, which rescued me without questioning my origins.

<br><br>

We visited various islands until I finally returned to <b>Baghdad</b>. Out of gratitude to God, I donated generously to the poor and mosques and spent time enjoying life with my friends.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b><br><br> The story teaches us the importance of <b>resilience</b>, <b>resourcefulness</b>, and <b>gratitude</b>. No matter how dire the circumstances, quick thinking and perseverance can lead to survival and eventual success. ]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[All the troubles and calamities I had undergone could not cure me of my inclination to make new voyages. I therefore bought goods, departed with them for the best seaport, and there, that I might not be obliged to depend upon a captain, but have a ship at my own command, I remained until one was built especially for me, at my own expense.

<br><br>

When the ship was ready, I went on board with my goods. Not having enough to load her fully, I agreed to take with me several merchants of different nations with their merchandise.

<br><br>

We sailed with the first fair wind, and after a long voyage, the first place we touched was a desert island, where we found an egg of a <b>roc</b>, equal in size to the one I had mentioned in my earlier adventures. A young roc was inside, just ready to hatch, with its beak breaking through the egg. The merchants who landed with me broke the egg with hatchets, made a hole in it, pulled out the young roc in pieces, and roasted it. I had in vain entreated them not to meddle with the egg.

<br><br>

Scarcely had they finished their meal when two large clouds appeared in the air at a considerable distance. The captain, knowing by experience what was about to happen, warned us that these were the male and female parents of the roc. He urged us to re-embark quickly to avoid the disaster he foresaw.

<br><br>

The two rocs approached with a frightful noise, which grew louder when they saw the egg broken and their young one gone. They flew back in the direction they had come from and disappeared for some time. We set sail as quickly as possible to avoid the danger.

<br><br>

Soon, the rocs returned, each carrying a massive rock in their talons. Hovering directly over my ship, one of them dropped a rock, but thanks to the steersman\'s skill, it missed and fell into the sea. Unfortunately, the second rock struck the ship directly, splitting it into pieces. All the mariners and passengers either perished or fell into the sea. I was among the latter, but I managed to grab hold of a plank. Floating with the wind and tide in my favor, I eventually reached an island and got safely ashore.

<br><br>

I sat on the grass to recover from my fatigue and then explored the island. It seemed like a beautiful garden, full of trees bearing both green and ripe fruits, and streams of fresh, pure water. I ate the fruits and drank the refreshing water.

<br><br>

As I ventured deeper into the island, I encountered an old man who appeared weak and infirm, sitting by a stream. Thinking him another shipwreck survivor, I greeted him, but he only nodded. When I asked why he was sitting still, he made a sign for me to carry him across the brook.

<br><br>

Believing he needed my help, I lifted him onto my back and carried him over. But as I stooped to let him down, he suddenly wrapped his legs around my neck tightly and strangled me until I fainted. Despite my unconsciousness, he stayed on my neck.

<br><br>

When I regained consciousness, he forced me to rise by kicking me and spurring me with his feet. I carried him unwillingly under the trees, stopping whenever he wished to gather and eat fruit. He remained on my shoulders day and night, pinching me in the morning to make me get up and continue walking.

<br><br>

One day, I found several dry calabashes that had fallen from a tree. I took a large one, cleaned it out, and filled it with grape juice. After some time, the juice fermented and turned into wine. Drinking it gave me new energy, and I began to sing and dance while carrying my burden.

<br><br>

The old man, noticing my high spirits, gestured for a drink. I handed him the calabash, and after drinking it all, he became drunk and loosened his grip around my neck. Taking advantage of his weakened state, I threw him off and killed him with a large stone.

<br><br>

Overjoyed to be free, I walked to the beach, where I met the crew of a ship taking in water. They were astonished to hear my story and told me I was the first to escape the <b>Old Man of the Sea</b>, a creature notorious for strangling his victims.

<br><br>

The crew took me to their captain, who kindly received me. We set sail and arrived at a great city where one of the merchants befriended me and took me along to gather <b>coconuts</b>. In the forest, we saw apes climb the tall trees when they noticed us. Following the merchants’ lead, I threw stones at the apes, who, in retaliation, threw down coconuts. We collected the coconuts and filled our sacks.

<br><br>

I exchanged my coconuts for <b>pepper</b> and <b>aloes wood</b> at various islands and even participated in pearl fishing, hiring divers who brought me large and pure pearls. Eventually, I returned to <b>Bussorah</b> and from there to <b>Baghdad</b>, where I earned a great fortune from my trade. As before, I gave a tenth of my profits in alms and rested from my hardships.

<br><br>

Sindbad then ordered one hundred sequins to be given to Hindbad and invited him and the other guests to dine with him the next day to hear the tale of his <b>sixth voyage</b>.

        <item><![CDATA[I know, my friends, that you will wish to hear how, after having been shipwrecked five times and escaping so many dangers, I could resolve again to tempt fortune and expose myself to new hardships. I am myself astonished at my conduct when I reflect upon it and must certainly have been actuated by my <b>destiny</b>, from which none can escape. <br/><br/>

Be that as it may, after a year’s rest, I prepared for a <b>sixth voyage</b>, notwithstanding the entreaties of my kindred and friends, who did all in their power to dissuade me. <br/><br/>

Instead of taking my way by the <b>Persian Gulf</b>, I traveled once more through several provinces of Persia and the Indies and arrived at a seaport, where I embarked on a ship. The captain was bound on a long voyage, during which he and the pilot lost their course. <br/><br/>

Suddenly, we saw the captain quit his rudder, uttering loud lamentations. He threw off his <b>turban</b>, pulled his beard, and beat his head like a madman. We asked him the reason, and he answered that we were in the most dangerous place in all the ocean. A rapid current carried the ship along with it, and we would all perish in less than a quarter of an hour. "Pray to God to deliver us from this peril, we cannot escape if He does not take pity on us." <br/><br/>

At these words, he ordered the sails to be lowered, but all the ropes broke, and the ship was carried by the current to the foot of an <b>inaccessible mountain</b>, where she struck and went to pieces. Yet, we saved our lives, our provisions, and the best of our goods. <br/><br/>

The mountain was covered with wrecks, countless human bones, and an incredible quantity of goods and riches of all kinds. These sights served only to augment our despair. Unlike other places where rivers flow from their channels into the sea, here a river of <b>fresh water</b> runs from the sea into a dark cavern, whose entrance is very high and spacious. <br/><br/>

Most remarkably, the mountain’s stones were made of <b>crystal</b>, <b>rubies</b>, and other precious stones. There was also a fountain of pitch or bitumen flowing into the sea, which fish would swallow and later expel as <b>ambergris</b>, which the waves then deposited on the shore in great quantities. <br/><br/>

We continued upon the shore, in a state of despair, expecting death every day. I survived all my companions, and when I buried the last, I had so little provisions left that I thought I could not last much longer. <br/><br/>

But it pleased God once more to take compassion on me, inspiring me to approach the riverbank, thinking: <br/><br/> "This river must lead somewhere. If I make a <b>raft</b> and leave myself to the current, it will carry me to some inhabited country, or I shall perish. If I drown, I lose nothing but only change one kind of death for another." <br/><br/>

I immediately went to work using large pieces of timber and cables from the wrecks and tied them together strongly, soon making a solid raft. After finishing it, I loaded it with chests of <b>rubies</b>, <b>emeralds</b>, <b>ambergris</b>, <b>rock crystal</b>, and bales of rich fabric. <br/><br/>

Once balanced and secured, I set off with two oars, leaving myself to the river’s course and surrendering to the will of God. <br/><br/>

As soon as I entered the cavern, I lost all light, and the stream carried me where I knew not. I floated on in perfect darkness, narrowly escaping danger when the arch nearly touched my head. I ate only what was necessary for survival, yet all my provisions eventually ran out. <br/><br/>

When I regained consciousness after fainting from exhaustion, I found myself on an extensive plain by a riverbank, with my raft tied among a group of <b>negroes</b>. They greeted me, though I did not understand their language. <br/><br/>

One among them, understanding Arabic, approached and said, "Brother, do not be surprised. We are inhabitants of this land and use this river to water our fields. We saw your raft, and one of us swam out to bring it to shore." <br/><br/>

After I ate, they asked about my story. Once I finished recounting my adventure, they insisted that I meet their king, as my story was too extraordinary for anyone else to tell. <br/><br/>

I was brought before the king of <b>Serendib</b>, who received me warmly and admired my treasures of <b>aloes wood</b>, <b>ambergris</b>, <b>rubies</b>, and <b>emeralds</b>. He refused to take anything from me and instead honored me with gifts and hospitality. <br/><br/>

Eventually, I sought permission to return to my homeland, and the king sent me off with rich presents and a letter for the <b>Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid</b>, affirming their friendship. <br/><br/>

The letter was written on rare yellowish skin with characters in azure, and the gifts included: <br/><br/>

    A ruby cup filled with pearls. <br/>
    A serpent\'s skin, whose scales preserved health. <br/>
    Fifty thousand drachms of fine aloes wood and thirty grains of <b>camphor</b>. <br/>
    A beautiful female slave adorned with jewels. <br/><br/>

When I returned to <b>Baghdad</b>, I delivered the gifts and letter to the Caliph, who was pleased with my account and rewarded me generously. <br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b> <br/> Perseverance and courage in the face of adversity can lead to unexpected rewards. Even in the darkest moments, hope and faith can guide us to fortune and favor.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[
On my return home from my <b>sixth voyage</b>, I had entirely given up all thoughts of going to sea again. Besides, my age now required rest, and I resolved never to expose myself to such risks again. I thought only of passing the rest of my days in <b>tranquillity</b>. <br/><br/>

One day, however, an officer of the caliph inquired for me. <br/><br/>

"The <b>Caliph</b>," said he, "has sent me to tell you that he must speak with you." <br/><br/>

I followed the officer to the palace and, upon being presented to the caliph, I saluted him by prostrating myself at his feet. <br/><br/>

"<b>Sindbad</b>," said he to me, "I stand in need of your services. You must carry my answer and present to the <b>King of Serendib</b>." <br/><br/>

This command was like a clap of thunder to me. <br/><br/>

"<b>Commander of the Faithful</b>," I replied, "I am ready to obey whatever your majesty commands, but I beseech you to consider what I have undergone. I have also made a vow never to leave <b>Baghdad</b> again." <br/><br/>

Perceiving the caliph insisted on my compliance, I submitted and told him I was willing to obey. He was pleased and ordered me <b>one thousand sequins</b> for the expenses of my journey. <br/><br/>

I prepared for departure, and as soon as the caliph’s letter and present were delivered to me, I went to <b>Bussorah</b>, where I embarked and had a very prosperous voyage. <br/><br/>

Upon arriving at the Isle of Serendib, I was conducted to the palace with much pomp and prostrated myself before the king. <br/><br/>

"<b>Sindbad</b>," said the king, "you are welcome; I have often thought of you and bless the day on which I see you again." <br/><br/>

I thanked him for his kindness and delivered the gifts from the caliph. <br/><br/>

The caliph’s letter read: <br/><br/>

<i>Greeting, in the name of the Sovereign Guide of the Right Way, from the servant of God, <b>Haroun-al-Raschid</b>, to the potent and esteemed <b>Raja of Serendib</b>.</i> <br/><br/>

<i>We receive your letter with joy and send you, from our imperial residence, this gift as a token of our friendship. May it bring you pleasure. Farewell.</i> <br/><br/>

The caliph’s present included: <br/><br/>

    A complete suit of cloth of gold, valued at <b>one thousand sequins</b>. <br/>
    Fifty robes of rich fabric. <br/>
    A hundred pieces of the finest white cloth from <b>Cairo</b>, <b>Suez</b>, and <b>Alexandria</b>. <br/>
    A vessel of <b>agate</b>, with a bas-relief of a man holding a bow aimed at a lion. <br/>
    A rich tablet believed to have belonged to <b>Solomon</b>. <br/><br/>

The king was highly gratified by the caliph’s friendship. A little time after, I requested permission to leave, which I obtained with much difficulty. The king, upon my departure, made me a considerable present. <br/><br/>

However, three or four days after our departure, pirates attacked our ship. We were easily captured since our vessel was not built for war. The pirates killed some of the crew who resisted and carried the rest of us into a remote island to be sold. <br/><br/>

I was purchased by a rich merchant who treated me well and clothed me like a slave. One day, he asked if I knew any trade. I told him I was a merchant and had been robbed of all I possessed. <br/><br/>

"Can you shoot with a bow?" he asked. <br/><br/>

I answered that archery had been one of my exercises in youth. He gave me a bow and arrows, took me on an elephant to a forest, and instructed me to climb a tree and shoot elephants for their ivory. <br/><br/>

For two months, I continued this task until one day the elephants, in great numbers, surrounded my tree and uprooted it. One of them gently picked me up with its trunk and carried me to a hill covered in ivory and bones. <br/><br/>

I realized the elephants meant no harm but were showing me where their dead lay, as if asking me to stop hunting them. I returned to my master, shared what had happened, and we gathered ivory without harming the animals. <br/><br/>

My master freed me and rewarded me with riches. I waited for a ship and eventually set sail for home. After stopping at various ports, I arrived safely in <b>Baghdad</b> and presented my gifts and accounts to the caliph, who honored me greatly. <br/><br/>

<b>Sindbad</b> here finished recounting his <b>seventh and final voyage</b>. Then, addressing <b>Hindbad</b>, he said: <br/><br/>

"Well, friend, have you ever heard of anyone who has suffered as much as I have? Is it not reasonable for me to enjoy a quiet and pleasant life now?" <br/><br/>

Hindbad, moved by his tale, replied, "Sir, my hardships are nothing compared to yours. You deserve all the riches you possess and the peace you now enjoy. May you live happily for a long time." <br/><br/>

Sindbad generously gave Hindbad <b>one hundred sequins</b> and told him to give up his burdens as a porter. He invited him to dine at his table and assured him that he now had a friend in <b>Sindbad the Sailor</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b> <br/> Perseverance through hardship often leads to great rewards. Generosity and kindness, as shown by Sindbad, enrich not only oneself but also those around us.

        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there lived an <b>unhappy young girl</b>. Unhappy she was, for her mother was dead, and her father had married another woman—a widow with two daughters. Her <b>stepmother</b> didn’t like her one little bit. <br/><br/>

All the nice things, kind thoughts, and loving touches were reserved for her own daughters. And not just the kindness and love, but also <b>dresses</b>, <b>shoes</b>, <b>shawls</b>, <b>delicious food</b>, <b>comfy beds</b>, and every home comfort. <br/><br/>

For the poor, unhappy girl, there was <b>nothing at all</b>. No dresses—only her stepsisters’ hand-me-downs. No lovely dishes—nothing but scraps. No comfort—only hard work all day. Only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders. That’s how she got her nickname: <b>Cinderella</b>. <br/><br/>

Cinderella used to spend long hours talking to the cat. The cat would say, <br/><br/>

<b>Miaow</b>, which really meant, <b>“Cheer up! You have something neither of your stepsisters has—<i>beauty</i>.”</b> <br/><br/>

It was true. Even dressed in rags, with a dusty gray face from the cinders, Cinderella was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter how elegant their clothes, were clumsy, lumpy, and ugly. <br/><br/>

One day, beautiful new dresses arrived at the house. A grand <b>ball</b> was to be held at Court, and the stepsisters were getting ready. Cinderella didn’t even dare to ask, <b>“What about me?”</b> because she knew the answer would be: <br/><br/>

<b>“You? My dear girl, you’re staying home to wash the dishes, scrub the floors, and turn down the beds for your stepsisters.”</b> <br/><br/>

Cinderella sighed at the cat, <b>“Oh dear, I’m so unhappy!”</b> And the cat murmured, <b>“Miaow.”</b> <br/><br/>

Suddenly, something amazing happened. A bright light appeared in the kitchen, and a <b>fairy</b> appeared. <br/><br/>

<b>“Don’t be alarmed, Cinderella,”</b> said the fairy. <b>“The wind blew me your sighs. I know you want to go to the ball, and so you shall!”</b> <br/><br/>

<b>“But how can I go dressed in rags?”</b> Cinderella asked. <br/><br/>

The fairy smiled and, with a flick of her magic wand, Cinderella found herself wearing the most <b>beautiful dress</b> in the realm. <br/><br/>

<b>“Now, let’s get you a coach,”</b> said the fairy. <b>“Quick, bring me a pumpkin!”</b> <br/><br/>

Cinderella rushed to fetch one, while the fairy asked the cat to bring <b>seven mice</b>. <br/><br/>

With another flick of the magic wand, the pumpkin became a <b>sparkling coach</b>, six mice turned into <b>white horses</b>, and the seventh into a <b>coachman</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>“Now remember,”</b> warned the fairy, <b>“You must leave the ball by midnight. After that, the spell will break.”</b> <br/><br/>

When Cinderella entered the ballroom, everyone stopped in awe of her <b>elegance</b>, <b>beauty</b>, and <b>grace</b>. <br/><br/>

The <b>Prince</b> was enchanted by her and asked her to dance. They danced together all evening. <br/><br/>

<b>“Who are you, fair maiden?”</b> the Prince asked. <br/><br/>

<b>“What does it matter? You will never see me again,”</b> she replied. <br/><br/>

Suddenly, the clock struck <b>midnight</b>! Remembering the fairy’s warning, Cinderella fled the palace, losing a <b>glass slipper</b> on the steps. <br/><br/>

The Prince picked up the slipper and vowed, <b>“I will find her. I will marry the one whose foot fits this slipper!”</b> <br/><br/>

The slipper fit no one—until Cinderella tried it on. To everyone’s shock, it fit perfectly! Her stepmother protested, but the fairy appeared and transformed Cinderella back into her splendid attire. <br/><br/>

The Prince proposed, and Cinderella accepted. They lived <b>happily ever after</b>. And as for the cat, he just said, <b>“Miaow.”</b> <br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
No matter how difficult life may seem, kindness, patience, and staying true to yourself will eventually bring happiness and reward.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[There was once a <b>woman</b> who wished very much to have a little <b>child</b>, but she could not fulfill her wish. At last, she went to a <b>witch</b> and said, "I would love to have a little child; can you tell me where I can find one?"

<br><br>
"Oh, that can be easily arranged," said the witch. "Here is a <b>barleycorn</b> of a different kind from those that grow in the farmer’s fields. Plant it in a flowerpot and see what happens."

<br><br>
The woman thanked the witch and gave her <b>twelve shillings</b>, the price of the barleycorn. She went home and planted it, and immediately, a large, handsome <b>flower</b> grew. It looked like a tulip but remained tightly closed.

<br><br>
"It is a beautiful flower," the woman said, kissing its red and golden leaves. As she did so, the flower opened, and inside, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a delicate and graceful little <b>maiden</b>. She was scarcely half as long as a thumb, so they named her <b>Thumbelina</b>, or <b>Tiny</b>, because she was so small.

<br><br>
A polished <b>walnut shell</b> served as her cradle, with a bed made of blue violet leaves and a <b>rose-leaf</b> for a blanket. At night, she slept in this cozy bed, and during the day, she played on a plate of water where a <b>tulip leaf</b> floated like a boat. She rowed herself from side to side with <b>two oars</b> made of white horsehair. Tiny could also <b>sing</b> so sweetly that no one had ever heard anything like her voice before.

<br><br>

One night, while she lay asleep, a large, <b>ugly toad</b> crept through a broken window, leaped onto the table, and said, "What a <b>beautiful wife</b> she would make for my son!" The toad grabbed the walnut shell with Tiny inside and hopped into the garden.
<br><br>
In a <b>swampy</b> part of a broad stream, the toad lived with her <b>uglier</b> son. When he saw the pretty maiden, all he could say was, "<b>Croak, croak, croak.</b>"
<br><br>
"Don't speak so loudly," said the mother toad. "She might wake up and run away, for she is as light as <b>swan’s down</b>. We shall place her on a <b>water lily leaf</b> so she cannot escape, while we prepare a home under the marsh."
<br><br>
They placed Tiny on a large green <b>lily pad</b> far out in the water. When she woke up in the morning and saw nothing but water around her, she wept bitterly.

<br><br>

The little <b>fishes</b> who swam beneath the leaf saw Tiny and felt sorry for her. "She must not stay with those ugly toads," they said. So they gnawed at the stem of the leaf until it broke free. The leaf floated down the stream, carrying Tiny far away.
<br><br>
As she sailed, little <b>birds</b> in the bushes saw her and sang, "What a lovely little creature!" A graceful <b>white butterfly</b> fluttered around her and finally landed on her leaf. Tiny was happy, for now, the toad could not reach her. She untied her <b>girdle</b>, fastened one end around the butterfly, and tied the other to the leaf, making it glide faster.
<br><br>
Just then, a large <b>cockchafer</b> flew by. Seeing Tiny, he grabbed her by the waist and flew into a <b>tree</b>. The leaf floated away, carrying the butterfly with it.
<br><br>
Tiny was frightened and especially sad for the butterfly, who would starve if he could not free himself. The cockchafer, however, paid no attention. He gave her <b>honey</b> and told her she was pretty—although, not like a cockchafer.
<br><br>
Soon, other cockchafers gathered and inspected her. "She has <b>only two legs</b>!" they cried. "She has <b>no feelers</b>! Her waist is too <b>slim</b>!"
<br><br>
"How <b>ugly</b>!" said all the lady cockchafers. The one who had captured her now believed them and let her go, leaving her on a <b>daisy</b>.
<br><br>
Tiny wept. She was the <b>loveliest</b> creature imaginable, yet even the cockchafers rejected her.

<br><br>

For the entire <b>summer</b>, Tiny lived alone in the great <b>forest</b>. She wove a bed from <b>blades of grass</b> and hung it beneath a <b>broad leaf</b> to protect herself from the rain. She drank <b>dew</b> and ate <b>nectar</b>.
<br><br>
But then <b>winter</b> came. The birds had flown away, the trees withered, and Tiny had no shelter. She shivered with cold, wrapping herself in a dry leaf. Snowflakes, as large as she was, fell upon her.
<br><br>
At last, she reached the <b>home</b> of a <b>field-mouse</b>. "Poor little creature," said the kind old mouse. "Come inside and warm yourself. If you clean my house and tell me stories, you may stay all winter."
<br><br>
Tiny was grateful and agreed. One day, the mouse said, "My <b>neighbor</b> visits soon. He is rich and wears a black <b>velvet coat</b>. If you marry him, you will never want for anything!"
<br><br>
But the <b>neighbor</b> was a <b>mole</b>, who despised the sun and lived in darkness. Tiny disliked him.
<br><br>
One day, Tiny found a <b>swallow</b>, half-dead in the mole’s tunnel. She secretly cared for him all winter. When spring came, the swallow invited Tiny to fly away with him, but she refused, not wanting to disappoint the field-mouse.

<br><br>

The field-mouse soon announced, "In <b>four weeks</b>, you shall marry the mole." Tiny <b>wept</b>. She would never see the bright sun again.
<br><br>
On the day of her wedding, she went outside to bid farewell to the sun. "Goodbye, bright sun!" she cried.
<br><br>
At that moment, she heard a familiar sound—"<b>Tweet, tweet!</b>"
<br><br>
It was the swallow! He had returned.
<br><br>
"Come with me," he said. "I will take you where the sun shines forever."
<br><br>
Tiny climbed onto his back, and they soared into the sky. They flew over mountains, forests, and rivers, reaching a land where it was always <b>summer</b>.

<br><br>

The swallow placed Tiny upon a <b>beautiful flower</b>. Inside, there stood a little <b>prince</b>, as small as Tiny. He was the <b>king</b> of the flowers. He placed a <b>gold crown</b> on her head and asked her to be his <b>queen</b>.
<br><br>
Tiny joyfully agreed. The flower fairies gifted her delicate <b>wings</b>, allowing her to fly. The swallow sang at her wedding, though his heart was heavy, for he loved Tiny too.
<br><br>
"You shall no longer be called <b>Tiny</b>," said the flower spirits. "Your new name shall be <b>Maia</b>."
<br><br>
The swallow bid her <b>farewell</b> and returned to Denmark. There, he sang outside the window of the writer who told this tale.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
No matter how small you are, you are capable of great things. True happiness is found when you follow your heart, and kindness is always rewarded.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Many, many years ago, in a kingdom far, far away, there lived a beautiful <b>princess</b>. <br/><br/>
She had long, <b>red hair</b> and loved <b>roses</b> so much that everyone called her <b>Princess Rose</b>. <br/><br/>

Every evening after dusk, Princess Rose went out onto her <b>balcony</b> and clapped her hands. <br/><br/>
A <b>golden bird</b> appeared out of nowhere and perched on her shoulder. <br/><br/>
Instantly, the princess’s hair began to <b>shine</b>, ablaze with a brilliant red glow. <br/><br/>

When the bird sang its enchanting melody, Princess Rose joined in, <br/><br/>
and the entire <b>kingdom</b> fell asleep, dreaming sweet dreams till the break of dawn. <br/><br/>

Thus, the years passed. Each night, Princess Rose and the golden bird sang their <b>lullaby</b>, <br/><br/>
filling the land with peace and pleasant dreams. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Witch’s Curse</b>

<br/><br/>

But one day, something <b>terrible</b> happened. <br/><br/>
A <b>wicked witch</b> learned of Princess Rose and decided to curse her. <br/><br/>

"<b>Abracadabra, Sim-Sala-Bim, may the rose’s color dim!</b>" the witch chanted. <br/><br/>

In an instant, Princess Rose’s <b>hair</b> turned as black as <b>tar</b>. <br/><br/>

That evening, she still stepped onto her <b>balcony</b> and clapped her hands. <br/><br/>
The golden bird appeared, but this time, her hair glowed <b>black</b> instead of red. <br/><br/>
The bird sang its melody, and the princess sang her lullaby. <br/><br/>

Everyone in the kingdom fell asleep, <br/><br/>
but that night, they had only <b>nightmares</b> and restless dreams. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

The next day, the saddened princess asked the bird, <br/><br/>
"<b>Tell me, golden bird, how can I make my people’s dreams sweet again till the break of dawn?</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>Black hair in rose water,</b>" the bird chirped in reply. <br/><br/>

Though puzzled, the princess followed its advice. <br/><br/>
She filled a basin with water and sprinkled <b>rose petals</b> over it. <br/><br/>
When she dipped her <b>black hair</b> into the rose water, it instantly turned red again. <br/><br/>

That evening, when the bird perched on her shoulder, <br/><br/>
the radiant red glow of her hair once more <b>lit up the night sky</b>. <br/><br/>
She sang her lullaby, and once again, the people had <b>sweet dreams</b>. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Witch’s Revenge</b>

<br/><br/>

The wicked witch was furious that her curse had been broken. <br/><br/>
She decided to cast it again. <br/><br/>

"<b>Abracadabra, Sim-Sala-Bim, may the rose’s color dim!</b>" <br/><br/>

Once again, the princess’s hair turned <b>black as tar</b>. <br/><br/>
But this time, the witch also picked every single <b>rose</b> from the entire kingdom. <br/><br/>

"<b>Let’s see how you’ll break my curse now!</b>" she cackled. <br/><br/>

That night, the princess again asked, <br/><br/>
"<b>Tell me, golden bird, how can I make my people’s dreams sweet again till the break of dawn?</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>Black hair in rose water,</b>" the bird repeated. <br/><br/>

"<b>But where can I find a rose?</b>" the princess cried. <br/><br/>

"<b>Black hair in rose water,</b>" the bird repeated and flew away. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Miracle of the Rose</b>

<br/><br/>

The princess was filled with sorrow. <br/><br/>
A single <b>tear</b> rolled down her cheek and fell to the ground. <br/><br/>

At that moment, a <b>young prince</b>, who had stopped beneath her balcony, <br/><br/>
reached into his pocket and pulled out a small <b>box</b>. <br/><br/>
Inside was a single strand of red hair. <br/><br/>

He bent down and placed the hair atop the princess’s fallen <b>tear</b>. <br/><br/>

Suddenly, a <b>miracle</b> happened—the red hair transformed into a <b>red rose</b>! <br/><br/>

The prince picked the rose and brought it to Princess Rose. <br/><br/>
Seeing it, she quickly wiped away her tears, plucked its <b>petals</b>, and dropped them into the basin of water. <br/><br/>
Then, she dipped her <b>black hair</b> into the water, and the curse was <b>broken</b> once again! <br/><br/>

Gasps of astonishment filled the air. <br/><br/>
The <b>King</b> turned to the prince and asked, "<b>Young man, where did you find that red hair?</b>" <br/><br/>

The prince smiled and said, <br/><br/>
"<b>When the princess and I were children, I took a single strand of her hair as a token of my loyalty. <br/><br/>
And she did the same, keeping a strand of my hair.</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>It’s true, Father,</b>" the princess confirmed, taking out a small <b>box</b>. <br/><br/>
Inside was a strand of the prince’s hair. <br/><br/>

The kingdom <b>rejoiced</b>. <br/><br/>
That very same day, Princess Rose and the prince were <b>married</b>. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Witch’s Defeat</b>

<br/><br/>

When the wicked witch learned that her curse had been broken once more, <br/><br/>
her <b>rage</b> grew so intense that she <b>exploded</b> into a thousand tiny pieces. <br/><br/>

From that day forward, <b>roses bloomed</b> in every garden throughout the kingdom. <br/><br/>
And each evening, Princess Rose sang her <b>loving lullaby</b>, <br/><br/>
ensuring that all her people had sweet dreams till the break of dawn. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>

<br/><br/>

True love and kindness can break even the darkest of curses. <br/><br/>
No matter how powerful evil may seem, goodness will always triumph in the end. <br/><br/>]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, as a <b>merchant</b> set off for the market, he asked each of his <b>three daughters</b> what she would like as a present upon his return. <br/><br/>

The first daughter wanted a <b>brocade dress</b>, the second a <b>pearl necklace</b>, but the third, whose name was <b>Beauty</b>—the youngest, prettiest, and sweetest of them all—said to her father: <br/><br/>

"<b>All I’d like is a rose you’ve picked especially for me!</b>" <br/><br/>

<b>The Mysterious Castle</b>

<br/><br/>

When the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. <br/><br/>
However, a sudden <b>storm</b> blew up, and his horse could barely move against the howling wind. <br/><br/>
Cold and weary, the merchant had almost lost hope of finding shelter when he noticed a <b>bright light</b> shining deep within a <b>forest</b>. <br/><br/>

As he drew closer, he saw that it was a <b>castle</b>, bathed in golden light. <br/><br/>
"<b>I hope I’ll find shelter there for the night,</b>" he thought to himself. <br/><br/>

When he reached the door, he found it was <b>open</b>, yet no one came to greet him. <br/><br/>
Summoning his courage, he stepped inside and called out, but no reply came. <br/><br/>

In the grand <b>hall</b>, a table was set with a splendid <b>feast</b>. <br/><br/>
The merchant hesitated, but as no one appeared, and hunger gnawed at him, he sat down and ate. <br/><br/>

Later, he wandered upstairs and discovered a room with a crackling <b>fire</b> and a soft, inviting <b>bed</b>. <br/><br/>
Too exhausted to resist, he lay down and fell into a deep sleep. <br/><br/>

When he awoke the next morning, he found a steaming cup of <b>coffee</b> and fresh <b>fruit</b> beside his bed. <br/><br/>
The merchant dressed and went downstairs to thank his mysterious host, but once again, no one was in sight. <br/><br/>

Shaking his head in wonder, he stepped outside to retrieve his <b>horse</b>. <br/><br/>
Suddenly, his eyes fell upon a <b>magnificent rose bush</b>. <br/><br/>

Remembering his promise to <b>Beauty</b>, he bent down to pick a single rose. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Beast’s Fury</b>

<br/><br/>

At that very moment, a horrible <b>Beast</b> appeared from the shadows, wearing <b>splendid clothes</b>. <br/><br/>
Two <b>bloodshot eyes</b> glared at him, and in a deep, terrifying voice, it growled: <br/><br/>

"<b>Ungrateful man! I gave you shelter, fed you at my table, and let you sleep in my home. <br/><br/>
And how do you repay me? By stealing my most precious flowers! For this, you must die!</b>" <br/><br/>

Trembling with fear, the merchant fell to his knees. <br/><br/>
"<b>Forgive me! Please, spare my life! The rose was not for me—it was for my daughter, Beauty! I promised her a rose from my journey!</b>" <br/><br/>

The Beast hesitated, lowering its mighty paw. <br/><br/>
"<b>I shall spare your life, but only on one condition—you must bring me your daughter!</b>" <br/><br/>

Faced with certain death if he refused, the merchant sorrowfully agreed. <br/><br/>
He returned home in <b>tears</b>, and his three daughters ran to greet him. <br/><br/>
Upon hearing his terrible tale, <b>Beauty</b> immediately stepped forward. <br/><br/>

"<b>Dear Father, I would do anything for you! Don't worry—you must keep your promise and save your life. Take me to the castle. I will stay there in your place!</b>" <br/><br/>

The merchant embraced his daughter with <b>tears of gratitude</b>. <br/><br/>
"<b>I never doubted your love for me. Thank you, my dear child, for saving my life.</b>" <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>Beauty and the Beast</b>

<br/><br/>

When Beauty arrived at the <b>castle</b>, she expected the Beast to be cruel and terrifying. <br/><br/>
But to her surprise, the Beast treated her with <b>kindness</b>. <br/><br/>

At first, she was <b>frightened</b> by his monstrous appearance. <br/><br/>
Yet, as days passed, she began to see his <b>gentle heart</b>. <br/><br/>

She lived in a <b>beautiful room</b>, embroidered by the fire, and dined at an elegant table. <br/><br/>
The Beast often sat nearby, speaking kindly to her. <br/><br/>
In time, Beauty realized that she enjoyed his <b>company</b>. <br/><br/>

One day, the Beast asked her to <b>marry him</b>. <br/><br/>

Taken by surprise, Beauty hesitated. <br/><br/>
How could she marry such an <b>ugly creature</b>? <br/><br/>
Yet, she did not want to hurt his feelings, for he had been nothing but kind to her. <br/><br/>

"<b>I... I don’t know what to say...</b>" she stammered. <br/><br/>

The Beast sighed. "<b>I understand.</b>" <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>Beauty’s Promise</b>

<br/><br/>

One day, the Beast gave Beauty a <b>magic mirror</b>. <br/><br/>
"<b>You will never feel lonely again,</b>" he said. <br/><br/>

Beauty gazed into it and saw her <b>father</b>, gravely ill. <br/><br/>
"<b>Please, let me go to him before it’s too late!</b>" she pleaded. <br/><br/>

The Beast hesitated, then said solemnly, "<b>If you promise to return in seven days, you may go.</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>I swear it!</b>" Beauty cried in joy. <br/><br/>

She rushed home and cared for her <b>father</b>. <br/><br/>
Days passed, and soon, he was well again. <br/><br/>
But Beauty had forgotten her promise. <br/><br/>

Then, one night, she awoke from a <b>terrible dream</b>. <br/><br/>
She saw the Beast, lying in agony, whispering, "<b>Come back... Come back to me...</b>" <br/><br/>

Filled with dread, Beauty rode swiftly back to the <b>castle</b>. <br/><br/>

She searched desperately until she found the Beast in the <b>garden</b>, collapsed and <b>near death</b>. <br/><br/>

"<b>Don’t die!</b>" she sobbed. "<b>I’ll marry you!</b>" <br/><br/>

At those words, a <b>miracle</b> occurred. <br/><br/>
The Beast transformed into a <b>handsome prince</b>. <br/><br/>

"<b>An evil witch cursed me long ago,</b>" he explained. <br/><br/>
"<b>Only the love of a maiden who could see past my monstrous form could break the spell.</b>" <br/><br/>

Beauty and the Prince were <b>married</b>, and the castle was filled with <b>roses</b>. <br/><br/>
From that day forward, it was known as the <b>Castle of the Rose</b>. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>

<br/><br/>

True beauty lies within the heart. <br/><br/>
Love and kindness can break any curse. <br/><br/>

        <item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, there was a beautiful girl named <b>Cinderella</b>. <br/><br/>
She lived with her <b>wicked stepmother</b> and <b>two stepsisters</b>, who treated her very badly. <br/><br/>

One day, they received an <b>invitation</b> to a grand ball at the <b>king’s palace</b>. <br/><br/>
Cinderella longed to go, but her stepmother refused to let her. <br/><br/>
Instead, she made Cinderella <b>sew beautiful gowns</b> for her and her daughters and curl their hair. <br/><br/>
Then, they left for the ball, leaving poor Cinderella alone at home. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Fairy Godmother’s Magic</b>

<br/><br/>

Cinderella felt very <b>sad</b> and began to cry. <br/><br/>
Suddenly, a <b>fairy godmother</b> appeared and said, "<b>Don’t cry, Cinderella! I will send you to the ball!</b>" <br/><br/>

Cinderella wiped her tears and said, "<b>But I don’t have a gown to wear for the ball!</b>" <br/><br/>
The fairy godmother waved her <b>magic wand</b>, and in an instant, Cinderella’s <b>old clothes</b> turned into a <b>beautiful gown</b>. <br/><br/>

Then, with another touch of her wand, she gave Cinderella <b>shimmering glass slippers</b>. <br/><br/>

"But how will I get there?" Cinderella asked. <br/><br/>

The fairy godmother noticed <b>six mice</b> playing near a pumpkin in the kitchen. <br/><br/>
She waved her wand again— <br/><br/>
The <b>pumpkin</b> transformed into a <b>golden coach</b>. <br/><br/>
The <b>mice</b> became four <b>black horses</b> and two <b>coachmen</b>. <br/><br/>

Cinderella was overjoyed and climbed into the coach. <br/><br/>
Before she left, the fairy godmother warned her: <br/><br/>

"<b>Cinderella, this magic will only last until midnight! You must return home before then!</b>" <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Grand Ball</b>

<br/><br/>

When Cinderella arrived at the <b>palace</b>, everyone was struck by her <b>beauty</b>. <br/><br/>
Even her <b>stepmother</b> and <b>stepsisters</b> did not recognize her. <br/><br/>

The handsome <b>prince</b> saw Cinderella and immediately fell in <b>love</b> with her. <br/><br/>
He walked up to her and asked, "<b>Would you like to dance?</b>" <br/><br/>
Cinderella smiled and said, "<b>Yes!</b>" <br/><br/>

The prince danced with Cinderella all night. <br/><br/>
She was so happy that she <b>forgot</b> the fairy godmother’s warning. <br/><br/>

Suddenly, the <b>clock began to strike midnight</b>. <br/><br/>
"<b>Oh no! I must go!</b>" Cinderella cried, rushing out of the palace. <br/><br/>

As she ran down the stairs, one of her <b>glass slippers</b> slipped off her foot. <br/><br/>
But she did not turn back. <br/><br/>

She reached home just as the <b>clock struck twelve</b>. <br/><br/>
Her golden <b>coach</b> turned back into a <b>pumpkin</b>. <br/><br/>
The <b>horses</b> became <b>mice</b> again, and her <b>gown</b> turned back into rags. <br/><br/>

A little later, her <b>stepmother</b> and <b>stepsisters</b> arrived home, talking excitedly about the <b>mystery princess</b> who had danced with the prince. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Glass Slipper</b>

<br/><br/>

The prince had <b>fallen in love</b> with Cinderella. <br/><br/>
But he did not even know her <b>name</b>. <br/><br/>

All he had was the <b>glass slipper</b> she had left behind. <br/><br/>

"<b>I will find her. The lady whose foot fits this slipper will be my bride!</b>" he declared. <br/><br/>

The next day, the prince and his <b>servants</b> traveled through the kingdom with the <b>glass slipper</b>. <br/><br/>
Every woman in the land tried it on, but it fit none of them. <br/><br/>

Cinderella’s <b>stepsisters</b> also tried on the slipper. <br/><br/>
They squeezed their feet, pushed hard, but it was no use—the slipper was <b>too small</b>. <br/><br/>

The stepmother refused to let Cinderella try on the slipper. <br/><br/>
But the prince saw her and said, "<b>Let her try it on!</b>" <br/><br/>

Cinderella gently slid her <b>foot</b> into the slipper. <br/><br/>
It fit <b>perfectly</b>. <br/><br/>

The prince <b>recognized her</b> instantly. <br/><br/>
"<b>You are the one I danced with at the ball!</b>" he exclaimed joyfully. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>Happily Ever After</b>

<br/><br/>

The prince <b>married</b> Cinderella, and they lived <b>happily ever after</b>. <br/><br/>
From that day forward, Cinderella’s days of sadness were over. <br/><br/>

She had finally found <b>love</b>, <b>happiness</b>, and a family who cherished her. <br/><br/>

And so, Cinderella became the <b>princess</b> of the kingdom, <br/><br/>
never to be treated cruelly again. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>

<br/><br/>

Kindness, patience, and a good heart are always rewarded. <br/><br/>

        <item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, there was a <b>king</b> who had <b>twelve beautiful daughters</b>. <br/><br/>
They slept in twelve beds, all in one room. <br/><br/>
Each night, their doors were <b>locked and secured</b>. <br/><br/>
Yet every morning, their <b>shoes</b> were mysteriously <b>worn out</b>, as if they had been dancing all night. <br/><br/>

Nobody could explain <b>how</b> or <b>where</b> they had gone. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The King\'s Challenge</b>

<br/><br/>

The king announced to the entire kingdom: <br/><br/>
"<b>Whoever can discover the secret of where my daughters dance at night will choose one as his wife and become my heir. <br/><br/>
But whoever tries and fails after three days and nights shall be put to death.</b>" <br/><br/>

A <b>young prince</b> came forward and accepted the challenge. <br/><br/>
He was given a chamber next to the princesses\' room. <br/><br/>
The door was left <b>open</b> so that he could watch them. <br/><br/>

However, as night fell, he quickly <b>fell asleep</b>. <br/><br/>
By morning, the princesses\' shoes were <b>worn out again</b>. <br/><br/>

The same thing happened on the second and third night. <br/><br/>
The king then <b>ordered his execution</b>. <br/><br/>

Many others attempted the task, but all <b>failed</b> and <b>lost their lives</b> in the same way. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Soldier and the Old Woman</b>

<br/><br/>

One day, a <b>soldier</b>, wounded in battle and unable to fight anymore, traveled through the kingdom. <br/><br/>
While walking through a <b>forest</b>, he met an <b>old woman</b>. <br/><br/>

"<b>Where are you going?</b>" she asked. <br/><br/>

"<b>I do not know yet,</b>" replied the soldier. "<b>But I would love to discover where the princesses dance. Then, perhaps, I could become king.</b>" <br/><br/>

The old woman smiled. <br/><br/>
"<b>That is not so difficult,</b>" she said. <br/><br/>
"<b>Do not drink the wine the princesses give you. Pretend to be asleep.</b>" <br/><br/>

Then she handed him a <b>cloak</b>. <br/><br/>
"<b>When you wear this, you will become invisible. You will be able to follow them unnoticed.</b>" <br/><br/>

The soldier thanked her and went to the <b>king’s palace</b>. <br/><br/>

He told the king he wished to try his luck. <br/><br/>

The king welcomed him and gave him <b>fine royal garments</b>. <br/><br/>

At night, he was led to his <b>chamber</b>. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Hidden Passage</b>

<br/><br/>

Before bed, the <b>eldest princess</b> brought him a cup of <b>wine</b>. <br/><br/>
The soldier <b>secretly threw it away</b> and pretended to sleep. <br/><br/>

The princesses laughed. <br/><br/>
"<b>This fool will end up like the rest,</b>" said the eldest. <br/><br/>

Then they <b>changed into elegant gowns</b> and prepared to leave. <br/><br/>

The <b>youngest princess</b> hesitated. <br/><br/>
"<b>I feel uneasy,</b>" she said. "<b>Something bad will happen tonight.</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>You are always afraid,</b>" replied the eldest. "<b>Nothing will happen!</b>" <br/><br/>

She clapped her hands. <br/><br/>
Suddenly, her <b>bed sank into the floor</b>, revealing a hidden <b>trapdoor</b>. <br/><br/>

The princesses went down one by one. <br/><br/>
The soldier quickly put on his <b>cloak of invisibility</b> and followed. <br/><br/>

On the stairs, he <b>accidentally stepped on the youngest princess’s dress</b>. <br/><br/>

"<b>Someone is following us!</b>" she cried. <br/><br/>

"<b>Nonsense!</b>" said the eldest. "<b>It was just a nail.</b>" <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Enchanted Groves and the Hidden Castle</b>

<br/><br/>

They walked through a <b>silver forest</b>, where the leaves sparkled beautifully. <br/><br/>
The soldier broke off a <b>branch</b> as proof. <br/><br/>

There was a loud <b>cracking sound</b>. <br/><br/>

"<b>Did you hear that?</b>" said the youngest princess. "<b>Something is wrong!</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>It is only the princes celebrating our arrival,</b>" the eldest said. <br/><br/>

They passed through a <b>golden forest</b> and a <b>diamond forest</b>. <br/><br/>
The soldier took a branch from each, making a loud <b>cracking noise</b> every time. <br/><br/>

Finally, they reached a <b>lake</b> with <b>twelve small boats</b>. <br/><br/>
Inside each boat was a <b>handsome prince</b>, waiting. <br/><br/>

The princesses stepped inside, and the soldier jumped into the <b>youngest princess’s boat</b>. <br/><br/>

"<b>This boat feels heavy,</b>" said the prince, rowing harder. "<b>It is harder to move tonight.</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>It must be the warm weather,</b>" said the princess. <br/><br/>

They reached a grand <b>illuminated castle</b>, filled with <b>music and dancing</b>. <br/><br/>
The princesses danced with their princes, while the invisible soldier danced among them. <br/><br/>

He <b>drank their wine</b>, emptying the cups before they could drink. <br/><br/>
This frightened the <b>youngest princess</b>, but the eldest reassured her. <br/><br/>

At <b>three o’clock</b>, their <b>shoes were worn out</b>. <br/><br/>
They returned across the lake, went back up the hidden passage, and fell asleep. <br/><br/>

The soldier did the same. <br/><br/>

This happened for <b>three nights</b>. <br/><br/>
On the final night, the soldier took a <b>golden cup</b> as proof. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Truth Revealed</b>

<br/><br/>

The next day, the soldier was brought before the <b>king</b>. <br/><br/>

"<b>Where do my daughters go at night?</b>" the king asked. <br/><br/>

"<b>They dance with twelve princes in a hidden castle underground.</b>" <br/><br/>

The princesses listened from behind the door. <br/><br/>
The soldier showed the <b>silver, gold, and diamond branches</b>, along with the <b>golden cup</b>. <br/><br/>

Realizing they had been <b>discovered</b>, the princesses <b>confessed</b>. <br/><br/>

The king asked the soldier, "<b>Which of my daughters will you choose as your wife?</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>I am not very young,</b>" said the soldier, "<b>so I will choose the eldest.</b>" <br/><br/>

That very day, they were <b>married</b>, and the soldier became the <b>king’s heir</b>. <br/><br/>

And so, the mystery of the twelve dancing princesses was solved. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>

<br/><br/>

Patience, wisdom, and courage can overcome any challenge. <br/><br/>
The truth will always come to light, no matter how well it is hidden. <br/><br/>]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, in a small village, there lived a <b>poor old woman</b>. <br/><br/>
One day, she gathered a dish of <b>beans</b> and prepared to cook them. <br/><br/>
To make the fire burn faster, she lit it with a handful of <b>straw</b>. <br/><br/>

As she emptied the beans into the pan, one <b>bean</b> accidentally fell to the ground. <br/><br/>
It landed next to a <b>piece of straw</b>. <br/><br/>
Soon after, a <b>burning coal</b> leaped out of the fire and landed beside them. <br/><br/>

The <b>straw</b> spoke first. <br/><br/>

"<b>Dear friends, where do you come from?</b>" it asked. <br/><br/>

The <b>coal</b> replied, "<b>I was lucky to escape the fire! Had I not jumped out, I would have burned to ashes.</b>" <br/><br/>

The <b>bean</b> sighed and said, "<b>I, too, have survived. If the old woman had thrown me into the pot, I would have been cooked into broth, like my poor comrades.</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>And what about me?</b>" asked the <b>straw</b>. "<b>She seized my brothers, sixty at a time, and threw them into the flames. I alone managed to slip through her fingers.</b>" <br/><br/>

<b>The Journey Begins</b>

<br/>

The <b>coal</b> then asked, "<b>What should we do now?</b>" <br/><br/>

The <b>bean</b> thought for a moment and said, "<b>Since we have all escaped death, let us stay together as good companions. To avoid any further danger, we should leave this place and travel to a foreign land.</b>" <br/><br/>

The idea pleased the others, and so they <b>set off on their journey</b>. <br/><br/>

Soon, they reached a small <b>brook</b>. <br/><br/>
There was no bridge or plank to cross it. <br/><br/>

The <b>straw</b> had an idea. "<b>I will lay myself across the water like a bridge. Then, you can walk over me safely.</b>" <br/><br/>

The <b>straw</b> stretched itself from one bank to the other. <br/><br/>

The <b>coal</b>, being bold and impatient, <b>stepped onto the bridge</b>. <br/><br/>
However, as she reached the middle, she heard the <b>water rushing below</b> and suddenly became afraid. <br/><br/>
She <b>froze</b>, unable to move forward or backward. <br/><br/>

The <b>straw</b> began to <b>burn</b> under the heat of the coal. <br/><br/>
It broke into two pieces and fell into the stream. <br/><br/>

The <b>coal</b> tumbled after it, let out a loud <b>hiss</b> as it touched the water, and was extinguished forever. <br/><br/>

<b>The Bean’s Laughter</b>
The <b>bean</b>, who had wisely stayed on the shore, <b>laughed</b> so hard at the sight that she suddenly <b>burst</b> open. <br/><br/>

She would have met the same fate as her companions had it not been for a <b>tailor</b> who happened to be sitting nearby. <br/><br/>

Seeing the <b>poor bean</b> split open, the tailor took pity on her. <br/><br/>
With his <b>needle and black thread</b>, he carefully <b>stitched her back together</b>. <br/><br/>

The <b>bean</b> thanked him <b>gratefully</b>. <br/><br/>
But because the tailor had used <b>black thread</b>, from that day forward, all <b>beans</b> have had a <b>black seam</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>

<br/><br/>

Not all companions are wise, and rushing into things without caution can lead to disaster. <br/><br/>
Sometimes, it is better to wait and think before acting. <br/><br/>]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, there was a <b>shepherd</b> who had a <b>faithful dog</b> named <b>Sultan</b>. <br/><br/>
Sultan had grown <b>very old</b> and had lost all his teeth. <br/><br/>

One day, as the shepherd and his wife stood outside their home, the shepherd said, <br/><br/>
"<b>I will shoot old Sultan tomorrow morning. He is of no use now.</b>" <br/><br/>

His wife protested, "<b>Please, let the poor creature live! He has served us loyally for many years. <br/><br/>
We owe it to him to care for him in his old age.</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>But what can we do with him?</b>" the shepherd replied. "<b>He has no teeth left, and thieves no longer fear him. <br/><br/>
True, he has served us well, but he only did so to earn his food. Tomorrow will be his last day, mark my words.</b>" <br/><br/>

<b>Sultan’s Plan</b>

<br/>

Poor <b>Sultan</b> lay nearby and overheard their conversation. <br/><br/>
He was terrified to think that the next day would be his last. <br/><br/>

That evening, he went into the forest to visit his old friend, the <b>wolf</b>, and told him his troubles. <br/><br/>

"<b>Do not worry, my friend,</b>" said the wolf. "<b>I have a plan to save you.</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>Tomorrow morning, your master and his wife will go to the field, taking their little child with them. <br/><br/>
They will lay the child down behind the hedge while they work. <br/><br/>
Lie down beside the child as if you are guarding it. I will come out of the woods and pretend to snatch the child away. <br/><br/>
You must chase after me and ‘rescue’ the child. When you return the child safely, your master will be so grateful that he will keep you forever.</b>" <br/><br/>

Sultan liked this plan, and so they put it into action. <br/><br/>

The next morning, when the wolf appeared and carried the child a short distance, the shepherd and his wife screamed in terror. <br/><br/>
Sultan quickly ran after the wolf, barking fiercely. <br/><br/>
The wolf let go of the child, and Sultan carried it back to his master. <br/><br/>

The shepherd was overjoyed. <br/><br/>
"<b>Old Sultan has saved our child! He will be well cared for as long as he lives. Wife, go home and prepare him a fine meal. <br/><br/>
He shall sleep on my old cushion from now on.</b>" <br/><br/>

From that day forward, Sultan had <b>everything he could wish for</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>The Wolf’s Betrayal</b>

<br/>

Soon after, the <b>wolf</b> came to visit Sultan. <br/><br/>

"<b>Congratulations, old friend,</b>" said the wolf. "<b>Now, you must return the favor. <br/><br/>
Look the other way when I come to take one of the shepherd’s fat sheep.</b>" <br/><br/>

But Sultan shook his head. <br/><br/>
"<b>No, I will be loyal to my master.</b>" <br/><br/>

The wolf was furious. "<b>So, you betray me?</b>" he growled. <br/><br/>

That night, the wolf sneaked into the farm, hoping to steal a sheep. <br/><br/>
But Sultan had warned the shepherd in advance. <br/><br/>
The shepherd waited behind the barn door with a <b>stout club</b>. <br/><br/>

As soon as the wolf tried to grab a sheep, the shepherd <b>beat him soundly</b>. <br/><br/>
The wolf barely managed to escape, bruised and humiliated. <br/><br/>

<b>The Duel in the Forest</b> <br/>

The next morning, the wolf sent a message to Sultan through a <b>wild boar</b>. <br/><br/>

"<b>You are a traitor, Sultan. Come to the forest and fight me, if you dare!</b>" <br/><br/>

Sultan had no choice but to accept the challenge. <br/><br/>

But he had no one to help him except the shepherd’s <b>old three-legged cat</b>. <br/><br/>
So, Sultan and the cat set off to face the wolf and the boar. <br/><br/>

As they approached, the <b>wolf</b> and <b>boar</b> saw them from a distance. <br/><br/>
The cat walked with difficulty, raising its tail high in the air. <br/><br/>

Seeing this, the wolf whispered, "<b>Look! Sultan is carrying a sword!</b>" <br/><br/>
The boar added, "<b>And every time the cat limps, she picks up a stone to throw at us!</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>We cannot fight them!</b>" the boar cried. <br/><br/>
In fear, he <b>hid behind a bush</b>, while the wolf <b>climbed up a tree</b>. <br/><br/>

When Sultan and the cat arrived, they were surprised to find no one there. <br/><br/>

But the boar had not hidden well—his <b>ears were sticking out</b>. <br/><br/>
Seeing something move, the cat thought it was a <b>mouse</b> and pounced on it, biting and scratching fiercely. <br/><br/>

The boar <b>squealed in pain</b>, jumped up, and ran away, crying, "<b>Look up in the tree! The real coward is hiding there!</b>" <br/><br/>

Sultan and the cat looked up and saw the wolf, trembling among the branches. <br/><br/>

"<b>Shame on you!</b>" they called. "<b>Come down and fight!</b>" <br/><br/>

The wolf, embarrassed and frightened, promised to <b>make peace</b> with Sultan. <br/><br/>

From that day forward, they were <b>friends once more</b>. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<br/>

Loyalty and kindness will always be rewarded. <br/><br/>

        <item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, a <b>king</b> had a beautiful <b>garden</b>. <br/><br/>
In the garden stood a <b>tree</b> that bore <b>golden apples</b>. <br/><br/>
The apples were counted daily, but every night, one would <b>disappear</b>. <br/><br/>

The king was <b>furious</b> and ordered the <b>gardener</b> to keep watch. <br/><br/>

The gardener sent his <b>eldest son</b>, but at <b>midnight</b>, he <b>fell asleep</b>. <br/><br/>
By morning, another apple was <b>gone</b>. <br/><br/>

The next night, the <b>second son</b> kept watch, but he too <b>fell asleep</b>. <br/><br/>
Again, an apple was missing. <br/><br/>

Finally, the <b>youngest son</b> asked to keep watch. <br/><br/>
Though his father was worried, he allowed it. <br/><br/>

At midnight, the boy heard a soft <b>rustling</b> in the air. <br/><br/>
A <b>bird of pure gold</b> flew down and plucked an apple. <br/><br/>
The boy shot an <b>arrow</b> at it, but only a <b>golden feather</b> fell to the ground. <br/><br/>

The next morning, he brought the feather to the <b>king</b>. <br/><br/>
The council agreed it was <b>more valuable</b> than anything in the kingdom. <br/><br/>
But the king said, "<b>One feather is not enough. I must have the whole bird!</b>" <br/><br/>

<b>The Eldest Son\'s Failure</b>

<br/>

The gardener\’s <b>eldest son</b> set off to find the golden bird. <br/><br/>
After traveling some distance, he reached a <b>forest</b> and saw a <b>fox</b>. <br/><br/>

Raising his <b>bow</b>, he prepared to shoot. <br/><br/>

"<b>Do not shoot me,</b>" the fox said. "<b>I can give you good advice. <br/><br/>
I know you seek the golden bird. <br/><br/>
Tonight, you will reach a village with two inns. One will be grand and inviting, the other poor and shabby. <br/><br/>
Stay in the shabby inn.</b>" <br/><br/>

The eldest son <b>ignored</b> the fox and shot at him. <br/><br/>
The arrow missed, and the fox ran into the woods. <br/><br/>

That evening, the son reached the <b>village</b>. <br/><br/>
He saw the two inns—the grand one was filled with <b>music and laughter</b>, while the shabby one looked <b>dreary</b>. <br/><br/>

"<b>Why should I stay in a poor inn?</b>" he thought. <br/><br/>
So he entered the grand inn, where he <b>ate, drank, and forgot</b> all about the golden bird. <br/><br/>



<b>The Second Son\’s Fate</b>

<br/>

When the eldest son did not return, the <b>second son</b> set out. <br/><br/>
He met the <b>fox</b>, who gave him the <b>same warning</b>. <br/><br/>
But when he reached the village, his <b>brother</b> called to him from the grand inn. <br/><br/>

Unable to resist, the second son joined his brother. <br/><br/>
Like him, he <b>forgot</b> his quest. <br/><br/>



<b>The Youngest Son and the Fox</b>

<br/>

Finally, the <b>youngest son</b> asked to go. <br/><br/>
His father hesitated but eventually agreed. <br/><br/>

On the way, the youngest son met the <b>fox</b>. <br/><br/>
He listened to the fox’s advice and did <b>not harm him</b>. <br/><br/>

"<b>Sit on my tail,</b>" said the fox, "<b>and I will take you swiftly.</b>" <br/><br/>

The boy sat down, and the fox <b>sped through the forest</b>. <br/><br/>

That night, the boy <b>avoided</b> the grand inn and slept peacefully in the shabby one. <br/><br/>

The next morning, the <b>fox returned</b>. <br/><br/>
"<b>Go to the castle ahead. The golden bird is inside. <br/><br/>
Many guards will be asleep. Take the bird, but do not put it in the golden cage!</b>" <br/><br/>

The boy did as he was told but thought, "<b>It is foolish to leave such a beautiful bird in an ugly cage.</b>" <br/><br/>
The moment he placed the bird in the golden cage, it <b>screamed loudly</b>. <br/><br/>

The guards <b>woke up</b> and seized him. <br/><br/>

The king sentenced him to <b>death</b> unless he could bring the <b>golden horse</b>, which ran <b>faster than the wind</b>. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Golden Horse</b>



The <b>fox</b> appeared again. <br/>
"<b>You should have listened!</b>" he scolded. "<b>But I will still help you.</b>" <br/><br/>

He took the boy to the next castle. <br/><br/>
The fox warned, "<b>Take the horse, but do not put on the golden saddle.</b>" <br/><br/>

But the boy <b>disobeyed</b>, and the horse <b>neighed loudly</b>, waking the guards. <br/><br/>
Once again, the boy was <b>caught</b>. <br/><br/>

This time, the king ordered him to fetch the <b>beautiful princess</b>. <br/><br/>



<b>The Princess</b>

<br/

The fox led him to the <b>princess’s castle</b>. <br/><br/>
"<b>At midnight, kiss her and take her. Do not let her say goodbye to her parents.</b>" <br/><br/>

But when the princess <b>begged in tears</b>, the boy <b>allowed</b> her to say farewell. <br/><br/>
The guards <b>seized him</b>. <br/><br/>

The king said, "<b>You may have my daughter only if you remove the hill blocking my window.</b>" <br/><br/>

The boy worked for <b>seven days</b>, but the hill remained. <br/><br/>

On the eighth day, the <b>fox</b> did the work overnight. <br/><br/>
The king had no choice but to <b>give up the princess</b>. <br/><br/>



<b>The Escape</b>

<br/>

With the fox’s plan, the boy <b>took the princess, the horse, and the bird</b> and escaped. <br/><br/>

The fox asked, "<b>Please, kill me.</b>" <br/><br/>

The boy refused, and the fox warned him, "<b>Beware of rivers and rescuing criminals.</b>" <br/><br/>

On his way home, the boy found his <b>two brothers</b> about to be <b>hanged</b>. <br/><br/>
He ignored the fox’s advice and <b>paid for their freedom</b>. <br/><br/>

As they rested by a river, the brothers <b>threw him in</b> and took his treasures. <br/><br/>

But the fox <b>saved him</b> once more. <br/><br/>
Disguised as a beggar, the boy <b>returned to the castle</b>. <br/><br/>

The moment he arrived, the horse <b>galloped</b>, the bird <b>sang</b>, and the princess <b>stopped weeping</b>. <br/><br/>
The brothers were <b>punished</b>, and the boy became <b>king</b>. <br/><br/>

One day, the fox returned and begged again to be <b>killed</b>. <br/><br/>
Finally, the boy agreed. <br/><br/>
At that moment, the fox transformed into the <b>princess’s long-lost brother</b>. <br/><br/>

And so, they all lived <b>happily ever after</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>

Always follow wise advice, and never let greed or emotion cloud your judgment. <br/><br/>
True loyalty and kindness will always lead to great rewards. <br/><br/>]]></item>

Daisy was the <b>elder sister</b>, and Rosie was the <b>younger one</b>. They lived in a <b>castle</b> as princesses. <br/><br/>

Daisy was <b>mean and selfish</b>. She loved to <b>hurt others</b>, including her sister, but she was <b>kind to her father</b> because she believed he would <b>hand over the kingdom</b> to her. <br/><br/>

Rosie, on the other hand, was <b>kind, loving, and helpful</b>. She <b>never complained</b> to her father. <br/><br/>

One day, the <b>King</b> decided to <b>divide the kingdom</b> into two equal halves for his daughters. <br/><br/>

He asked Daisy, <b>"Daisy, what do you love the most in the world?"</b> <br/><br/>

Daisy thought if she said <b>pearls or jewels</b>, her father might be displeased and give the <b>entire kingdom</b> to Rosie. So, she <b>lied</b>, "Daddy, of course, it is you!" <br/><br/>

When it was Rosie’s turn, she smiled and said, <b>"Oh! Daddy, I love millions of things. But my favorites are rain, rainbows, smiling babies, helping others, and seeing people happy."</b> <br/><br/>

The King’s face <b>turned red with anger</b>. He <b>punished Rosie</b> by asking her to <b>leave the kingdom for a week</b>. <br/><br/>

Rosie <b>left the castle feeling sad</b>. As she walked, she heard <b>sobbing</b>. It was a <b>coconut tree</b>. Rosie asked why it was crying. <br/><br/>

The tree replied, <b>"No one has watered me for days. I might die."</b> <br/><br/>

Rosie said, <b>"Don’t worry, my friend. I will help you."</b> She dug a <b>narrow canal</b> from a nearby <b>lake</b>, allowing water to reach the tree. <br/><br/>

The <b>coconut tree</b> was immensely happy and thanked her. Rosie waved and <b>continued her journey</b>. <br/><br/>

She then saw a <b>cow and a calf</b> crying. <br/><br/>

The calf said, <b>"My mother has not had hay for days. If this continues, she won’t be able to feed me, and I will starve. Our master is away."</b> <br/><br/>

Rosie reassured them and <b>searched for hay</b>. She returned with a <b>big bundle</b> and fed them. The cow and the calf <b>thanked her</b>. <br/><br/>

Rosie smiled and <b>walked ahead</b>. <br/><br/>

Soon, she heard <b>tiny voices crying</b>. She searched and found it was <b>a group of ants</b>. Their <b>anthill had been washed away</b> due to heavy rain. <br/><br/>

Rosie said, <b>"I will help you."</b> She gathered <b>mud</b> and helped them <b>build a new anthill</b>. The ants <b>jumped in joy</b> and <b>thanked her</b>. <br/><br/>

As Rosie walked farther, she entered a <b>forest</b> and saw a <b>hut</b>. <br/><br/>

She was <b>tired</b> and <b>knocked on the door</b>. An <b>old woman</b> opened it. <br/><br/>

Rosie said, <b>"May I rest here? I will do all your housework in return."</b> <br/><br/>

The old woman welcomed her, gave her <b>food</b>, and let her <b>stay for a week</b>. Rosie did not tell her that she was a <b>princess</b> because she did not want to be treated specially. <br/><br/>

Before leaving, the old woman gave Rosie <b>a special box</b> and said, <b>"Open this only in your room."</b> <br/><br/>

Rosie returned to the <b>castle</b>. On her way, the <b>ants gave her gems and jewels</b>, the <b>cow’s master gave her milk and sweets</b>, and the <b>coconut tree gave her special coconuts</b>. <br/><br/>

The King was <b>shocked</b> to see her. <br/><br/>

Daisy was <b>jealous</b>. She went to the same places Rosie had visited. But <b>she refused to help</b> the <b>coconut tree, the cow, and the ants</b>. <br/><br/>

She reached the <b>old woman’s house</b> and <b>demanded gifts</b> without helping with chores. <br/><br/>

On her way back, the <b>ants bit her</b>, the <b>cow kicked her</b>, and the <b>coconut tree dropped coconuts on her head</b>. <br/><br/>

        <item><![CDATA[There once lived an <b>old man</b> on the shore of a <b>beautiful sea</b>. All day, he wove nets and caught fish. There were so many that the <b>old fisherman</b> shared them with his animals. He had a <b>nice dog</b> and an <b>evil black cat</b>. The dog was called <b>Boley</b>, and the cat was called <b>Serzhina</b>.

<br><br>

<b>"Boley!"</b> shouted the old man to his dog, and it came at once.

<br><br>

<b>"Boley, bring me some water because I’m thirsty!"</b> The dog dashed away and, in a little while, came back with the water.

<br><br>

<b>"Here’s a fish for you,"</b> the old man said as he stroked him.

<br><br>

<b>"Serzhina!"</b> shouted the old fisherman to his cat this time, but <b>Serzhina</b> didn’t appear.

<br><br>

<b>"Serzhina! Serzhina!"</b> he shouted again, but again, nothing happened.

<br><br>

<b>"Serzhina, do you want a fish?!"</b>

<br><br>

As soon as the old man said these words, the <b>cat jumped from the roof</b> and meowed around his legs with a <b>phony purr</b>.

<br><br>

<b>"I want a fish. Meow, meow…"</b>

<br><br>

<b>"Here is your fish. Now bring me my hat because I’m getting hot."</b>

<br><br>

The <b>cat took the fish</b>, jumped on the hat rack, and brought the old fisherman his hat.

<br><br>

<b>"Black cat, evil cat,"</b> yelped the dog.

<br><br>

<b>"Don’t say that!"</b> the old man scolded him.

<br><br>

The next day, the <b>old fisherman got sick</b>. He had a <b>high fever</b> and couldn’t get out of bed.

<br><br>

<b>"Boley, bring me a pill from the shelf,"</b> he said.

<br><br>

The dog tried to jump on the cabinet where the pills were, but he <b>couldn’t reach it</b>.

<br><br>

<b>"Serzhina!"</b> called the old man, but the cat didn’t appear.

<br><br>

<b>"Serzhina! Serzhina!"</b> he shouted again, but again, nothing happened.

<br><br>

<b>"Serzhina, do you want a fish?!"</b>

<br><br>

As soon as the old man said these words, the <b>cat jumped from the roof</b> and meowed, <b>"Meow, meow… I want a fish."</b>

<br><br>

<b>"Serzhina, I can’t go fishing today because I’m sick. When I get better, there’ll be enough for everyone. Hurry, Serzhina, bring me the pill from the shelf."</b>

<br><br>

The cat jumped on the shelf, but instead of bringing the pill to the old man, she purred again, <b>"I want a fish. Meow, meow…"</b>

<br><br>

<b>"Serzhina, please, bring me the pill; otherwise, I won’t be able to get up,"</b> sadly repeated the old man, but the cat didn’t budge. The poor old man didn’t know what to do and began to cry from anguish.

<br><br>

All at once, the dog yelped, <b>"Woof, woof, woof…"</b>

<br><br>

The old man turned toward <b>Boley</b> and saw a pill on the ground. <b>"For sure, it accidentally fell,"</b> he thought to himself and looked toward the shelf where <b>Serzhina</b> was.

<br><br>

The dog brought the pill to the old fisherman, and a little while later, his temperature began to fall. When the old man woke up the next morning, he was healthy again. He impatiently threw the net into the sea and caught a lot of fish. He sat down on his chair in front of the house and watched the waves with his pipe in his hand.

<br><br>

<b>"Master, this cat will be our undoing! Let’s drive her away! Black cat, evil cat!"</b> yelped the dog.

<br><br>

<b>"May it never be! You’ll see that Serzhina will change and will become good."</b>

<br><br>

<b>"Master, do you remember that you said the same thing about her mother? That cursed black Isolda, who tore up your nets every night while she was alive?"</b>

<br><br>

<b>"Boley, we have to believe in the power of good. You’ll see. One day, Serzhina will change and will become good."</b>

<br><br>

The old fisherman drew on his pipe and became lost in thought, but not for long, because the dog again said, <b>"Master, aren’t we going to have breakfast?"</b>

<br><br>

<b>"Do you want a fish?"</b>

<br><br>

<b>"Woof, woof!"</b> barked the dog with his tongue lolling out. The old man threw him a few large mackerels and patted him on the neck.

<br><br>

Just then, the hungry <b>Serzhina</b> jumped off the roof. <b>"Meow, meow, I want a fish."</b>

<br><br>

The old man threw her a fish and then said, <b>"Please, Serzhina, don’t act that way again."</b>

<br><br>

The cat purred and continued to rub against the old fisherman’s hand while he slept peacefully on the chair.

<br><br>

Unfortunately, when he woke up, the old man saw that the thatched roof of his house was <b>burning</b>.

<br><br>

<b>"Boley, Serzhina, help me! Bring water from the sea! Hurry!"</b> The dog dashed off, but the cat didn’t budge.

<br><br>

The old man threw her a fish, and she ran to the water, but after a while, she fell asleep. The old fisherman threw another fish to the black cat, and once again, she began to help put out the fire but only for a short while. A little later, the fish ran out, and Serzhina went to sleep again. The dog kept on until he was exhausted, but the fire covered the whole house.

<br><br>

The poor old man wept because he had been left without a home.

<br><br>

<b>"Enough! I can’t take it anymore! Black cat, evil cat!"</b> he raged. Then he grabbed Serzhina and angrily threw her into the sea.

<br><br>

Finally, the old man had escaped from the black cat; however, the sea grew <b>black</b>.

<br><br>

<b>--- Moral of the Story ---</b><br/>

A person without faith is like a net without fish. Good and evil exist in everyone, but what we choose to believe in shapes our world. If we lose faith in goodness, we may find ourselves surrounded by darkness. But if we believe in kindness, even in the unlikeliest places, life will reward us in unexpected ways.]]></item>

Seeing Beauty’s sadness, the Beast gave her a <b>magic mirror</b> and said, <b>"Look into the mirror, and you can see your family. Now you won’t feel lonely anymore."</b>

<br><br>

One day, Beauty looked in the mirror and saw that her <b>father was very ill</b> and near death. She pleaded with the Beast, <b>"Please let me go home! I only want to see my father before he dies!"</b>

<br><br>

The Beast <b>roared angrily</b>, <b>"No! You promised you would never leave this castle!"</b> He stormed out of the room. But later, he returned with a soft heart and said, <b>"You may go to stay with your father for seven days. But you must promise to return after that."</b>

<br><br>

Beauty was overjoyed and agreed. She rushed home, and upon seeing her, her father felt <b>happy</b> and soon <b>recovered</b>. Beauty stayed for <b>more than seven days</b> and forgot about the Beast and the castle.

<br><br>

One night, she had a <b>terrible nightmare</b>. She saw the Beast <b>lying weak and dying</b>, crying, <b>"Beauty, please come back!"</b>

<br><br>

Beauty <b>woke up in shock</b> and rushed back to the castle. She found the Beast lying on the ground, barely alive. She <b>wept</b> and said, <b>"Please don’t die, Beast! I will live with you forever!"</b>

<br><br>

At that moment, the Beast <b>miraculously transformed</b> into a <b>handsome prince</b>. He said, <b>"I was under a curse for many years. Only true love could break it. Because you truly love me, I am free!"</b>

<br><br>

Soon, <b>Beauty and the Prince</b> were <b>married</b> and lived <b>happily ever after</b>.

<br><br>

<br><br>

One day, while playing in the garden, the ball <b>fell into a pond</b>. She was <b>very upset</b> and did not know what to do. As she sat there crying helplessly, a <b>frog</b> hopped out of the pond and asked, <b>"Why are you crying, little princess?"</b>

<br><br>

She told him about her <b>golden ball</b>. The <b>ugly frog</b> said, <b>"I can help you get your ball, but what will you give me in return?"</b>

<br><br>

<b>"I will give you anything you want!"</b> promised the princess. The frog immediately <b>dived into the water</b> and fetched the ball for her. The princess was <b>very happy</b>.

<br><br>

The frog then reminded her, <b>"Remember that you promised me anything. Well, I want to be your friend, eat from your plate, and sleep in your palace!"</b>

        <item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, there lived a <b>lovely princess</b> with <b>fair skin</b> and <b>blue eyes</b>. She was so fair that she was named <b>Snow White</b>.

<br><br>

Her mother died when Snow White was a baby, and her father married again. The new <b>queen</b> was <b>very pretty</b> but also <b>very cruel</b>. The wicked stepmother wanted to be the <b>most beautiful lady</b> in the kingdom. Every day, she would ask her <b>magic mirror</b>,

<br><br>

<b>"Mirror! Mirror on the wall! Who is the fairest of them all?"</b>

<br><br>

And the magic mirror would reply, <b>"You are, Your Majesty!"</b>

<br><br>

But one day, the mirror replied, <b>"Snow White is the fairest of them all!"</b>

<br><br>

The wicked queen was <b>furious</b> and <b>jealous</b> of Snow White. She ordered her huntsman, <b>"Take Snow White to the forest and kill her! I want you to bring back her heart."</b>

<br><br>

However, when the huntsman took Snow White to the forest, he <b>felt pity for her</b> and set her free. He killed a deer instead and took its heart to the wicked queen, pretending that it was Snow White’s.

<br><br>

<b>Snow White wandered</b> in the forest all night, crying.

<br><br>

When daylight came, she found a <b>tiny cottage</b> and went inside. There was nobody there, but she saw <b>seven plates</b> on the table and <b>seven tiny beds</b> in the bedroom. She cooked a <b>wonderful meal</b>, cleaned the house, and, feeling tired, finally slept on one of the tiny beds.

<br><br>

That night, the <b>seven dwarfs</b> who lived in the cottage came home and found Snow White sleeping. When she woke up and told them her story, the dwarfs <b>invited her to stay with them</b>.

<br><br>

During the day, when the dwarfs were away, Snow White would <b>cook delicious meals</b> and take care of the house. The dwarfs <b>loved her dearly</b> and cared for her. Every morning before leaving, they <b>warned her</b>,

<br><br>

<b>"Never open the door to strangers!"</b>

<br><br>

<b>Meanwhile, in the palace</b>, the wicked queen asked her mirror again,

<br><br>

<b>"Mirror! Mirror on the wall! Who is the fairest of them all?"</b>

<br><br>

The mirror replied, <b>"Snow White is the fairest of them all! She lives with the seven dwarfs in the woods!"</b>

<br><br>

The wicked stepmother was <b>furious</b>. She was actually a <b>witch</b> who knew how to make <b>magic potions</b>. She made a <b>poisonous potion</b> and dipped a <b>shiny red apple</b> into it.

<br><br>

Then, she <b>disguised herself</b> as an old peasant woman and went to the woods. She knocked on the cottage door and said,

<br><br>

<b>"Pretty little child! Let me in! Look what I have for you!"</b>

<br><br>

But Snow White replied, <b>"I am sorry, old lady, but I cannot let you in! The seven dwarfs told me not to talk to strangers!"</b>

<br><br>

However, when Snow White saw the <b>shiny red apple</b>, she <b>could not resist</b> and opened the door. The wicked witch offered her the apple, and as soon as Snow White took a bite, she <b>fell into a deep sleep</b>.

<br><br>

The wicked stepmother returned to the palace and asked the mirror,

<br><br>

<b>"Mirror! Mirror on the wall! Who is the fairest of them all?"</b>

<br><br>

The mirror replied, <b>"You are, Your Majesty!"</b> and the queen was finally happy.

<br><br>

When the <b>seven dwarfs</b> came home and found Snow White lying on the floor, they were <b>heartbroken</b>. They <b>cried all night</b> and then built a <b>glass coffin</b> for her. They kept it in front of the cottage.

<br><br>

One day, <b>Prince Charming</b> was passing by and saw Snow White lying in the coffin. He said to the dwarfs,

<br><br>

<b>"My! My! She is so beautiful! I would like to kiss her!"</b>

<br><br>

And so, he kissed her. <b>Immediately, Snow White opened her eyes!</b> She was <b>alive again</b>!

        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, down on an old farm, lived a duck family. Mother Duck had been sitting on a clutch of eggs, waiting for them to hatch.

<br/><br/>

One fine morning, the eggs began to crack, and out popped six chirpy little ducklings. But one egg, which was much bigger than the rest, still had not hatched.

<br/><br/>

"How did this egg get here?" wondered Mother Duck.

<br/><br/>

Suddenly—TOCK! TOCK!—the little prisoner inside the shell started pecking its way out.

<br/><br/>

When the last egg finally hatched, out came a strange-looking duckling with gray feathers instead of yellow. Mother Duck stared at him, worried.

<br/><br/>

As the ducklings grew, Mother Duck couldn’t help but notice how different her youngest was.

<br/><br/>

"I can’t understand how this ugly duckling can be one of mine!" she thought, shaking her head.

<br/><br/>

The gray duckling was not as pretty as his brothers and sisters. He also ate much more than them and was growing faster. As days passed, the poor ugly duckling became more and more unhappy.

<br/><br/>

His siblings refused to play with him because he was too clumsy. The farmyard animals laughed at him. He felt sad and lonely, even though Mother Duck tried her best to comfort him.

<br/><br/>

"Poor little ugly duckling! Why are you so different from the others?" she would say.

<br/><br/>

At night, the ugly duckling cried to himself.

<br/><br/>

"Nobody loves me! They all tease me! Why am I so different from my brothers?"

<br/><br/>

The Ugly Duckling Runs Away
<br/><br/>

One morning, at sunrise, he ran away from the farmyard.

<br/><br/>

He stopped by a pond and asked the birds, "Do you know of any ducklings with gray feathers like mine?"

<br/><br/>

But everyone shook their heads.

<br/><br/>

"We don’t know anyone as ugly as you!" they sneered.

<br/><br/>

Still, the ugly duckling did not give up. He kept searching for a place where he belonged.

<br/><br/>

He came to another pond where two large geese lived.

<br/><br/>

"Do you know any ducklings that look like me?" he asked.

<br/><br/>

But the geese warned him instead.

<br/><br/>

"You should leave this place! It’s dangerous—hunters with guns are nearby!"

<br/><br/>

Frightened, the duckling ran away again.

<br/><br/>

Captured by an Old Woman
<br/><br/>

After wandering for days, he found himself near an old woman’s cottage.

<br/><br/>

Thinking he was a young goose, the woman caught him.

<br/><br/>

"I hope it’s a female and lays plenty of eggs!" she said, placing him in a hutch.

<br/><br/>

But the ugly duckling could not lay eggs. The hen and cat in the cottage teased him.

<br/><br/>

"Just wait! If you don’t lay eggs, the old woman will wring your neck and cook you for dinner!" the hen warned.

<br/><br/>

"Hee! Hee! I hope she does! Then I can gnaw on your bones!" laughed the cat.

<br/><br/>

Terrified, the ugly duckling lost his appetite, even though the old woman kept feeding him.

<br/><br/>

"If you won’t lay eggs, at least get fat quickly!" she grumbled.

<br/><br/>

One night, finding the hutch door open, the duckling escaped.

<br/><br/>

"I’ll hide forever where no one can find me!" he thought.

<br/><br/>

He found a thick bed of reeds and decided to stay there. It was peaceful, and there was enough food. Though still lonely, the ugly duckling felt a little happier.

<br/><br/>

A New Hope
<br/><br/>

One day at sunrise, he saw a group of beautiful birds flying overhead.

<br/><br/>

They had long, slender necks, yellow beaks, and large white wings. They were swans, migrating south for the winter.

<br/><br/>

"If only I could look like them, just for a day!" the duckling sighed, admiring them.

<br/><br/>

Winter arrived, and the pond froze over. Desperate for food, the ugly duckling wandered into the snowy countryside.

<br/><br/>

Exhausted, he collapsed.

<br/><br/>

A kind farmer found him.

<br/><br/>

"Poor thing, he’s frozen! I’ll take him home to my children!" the farmer said, putting the duckling in his coat.

<br/><br/>

At the farmer’s house, he was cared for and kept warm throughout the harsh winter.

<br/><br/>

By the time spring arrived, the duckling had grown much bigger.

<br/><br/>

"You’re too big now," said the farmer. "I’ll set you free by the pond."

<br/><br/>

The Transformation
<br/><br/>

As the ugly duckling glided onto the water, he saw his reflection for the first time.

<br/><br/>

He gasped.

<br/><br/>

"Goodness! How I’ve changed! I hardly recognize myself!"

<br/><br/>

He was no longer an ugly duckling—he was a beautiful swan!

<br/><br/>

Just then, the same group of swans he had admired months ago returned. They glided onto the pond and greeted him warmly.

<br/><br/>

"We are swans like you! Where have you been hiding?" they asked.

<br/><br/>

Still in shock, the young swan replied, "It’s a long story!"

<br/><br/>

Now, he swam gracefully with his fellow swans.

<br/><br/>

One day, children on the riverbank saw him.

<br/><br/>

"Look at that young swan! He’s the most beautiful of them all!" they exclaimed.

<br/><br/>

Hearing this, the young swan felt his heart fill with joy.

<br/><br/>

For the first time in his life, he was truly happy.

<br/><br/>

Moral of the Story
<br/><br/>

💡 True beauty comes from within. Never judge others by their appearance.

<br/><br/>

💡 Sometimes, hardships lead to something better. Stay patient, and you will find happiness.

        <item><![CDATA[<b>Rapunzel</b><br><br>
There was once a couple who had long wished in vain for a child. At length, the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. They had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, full of beautiful flowers and herbs. However, it was surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world.<br><br>

One day, the woman was standing by this window, looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed planted with the most beautiful rampion—<b>Rapunzel</b>. It looked so fresh and green that she longed for it and had the greatest desire to eat some. This desire increased every day, and as she knew she could not get any of it, she quite pined away and began to look pale and miserable.<br><br>

Her husband, alarmed, asked, "What makes you sad, dear wife?"<br><br>

"Ah," she replied, "if I can’t eat some of the rampion from the garden behind our house, I shall die."<br><br>

The man, who loved her dearly, thought, <i>sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.</i> At twilight, he climbed over the wall into the enchantress’s garden, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad and ate it greedily. It tasted so good—so very good—that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before.<br><br>

If he was to have any peace, her husband had to descend into the garden once more. In the gloom of the evening, he let himself down again. But when he had clambered down the wall, he was terribly afraid, for there stood the enchantress before him.<br><br>

"How dare you," said she angrily, "descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it."<br><br>

He pleaded, "Let mercy take the place of justice. I only did it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she hadn’t had some to eat."<br><br>

The enchantress softened her anger and said, "If the case is as you say, I will allow you to take as much rampion as you want. But I make one condition—you must give me the child your wife will bring into the world. It will be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother."<br><br>

In his fear, the man consented to everything. When the woman gave birth, the enchantress appeared at once, named the child <b>Rapunzel</b>, and took her away.<br><br>

<b>Rapunzel</b> grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower deep in the forest, which had neither stairs nor a door—only a little window at the top. When the enchantress wanted to enter, she would stand beneath the tower and cry, <br><br>

"<b>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me.</b>"<br><br>

Rapunzel had magnificent, long hair as fine as spun gold. Whenever she heard the enchantress’s voice, she would unfasten her braided tresses, wind them around a hook near the window, and let the hair fall twenty ells down, allowing the enchantress to climb up.<br><br>

After a year or two, it came to pass that a king’s son rode through the forest and passed by the tower. He heard a song so beautiful that he stood still and listened. It was Rapunzel, who, in her solitude, spent her time letting her sweet voice resound.<br><br>

The king’s son wanted to climb up to her and looked for a door but found none. He returned daily, enchanted by her voice. One day, hiding behind a tree, he saw the enchantress approach and heard her call, <br><br>

"<b>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me.</b>"<br><br>

The prince thought, <i>If that is the ladder by which one climbs, I, too, will try my luck.</i><br><br>

The next evening, as darkness fell, he went to the tower and called out, "<b>Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair.</b>"<br><br>

Immediately, the hair fell, and the king’s son climbed up. At first, Rapunzel was frightened—she had never seen a man before. But the prince spoke kindly and told her that her singing had touched his heart. Over time, she lost her fear, and when he asked her to marry him, she agreed.<br><br>

"I will gladly go with you," Rapunzel said, "but I don’t know how to get down. Bring a skein of silk every time you come, and I will weave a ladder. When it is ready, I will climb down, and you will take me away on your horse."<br><br>

They agreed to meet every evening, as the old woman visited during the day. Everything went unnoticed until one day Rapunzel innocently asked the enchantress, <br><br>

"Tell me why it is that you are heavier to pull up than the young king’s son—he climbs in a moment."<br><br>

"You wicked child!" cried the enchantress. "What do I hear? I thought I had separated you from all the world, yet you have deceived me!"<br><br>

In her fury, she grabbed Rapunzel’s beautiful hair, wrapped it around her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with her right, and <i>snip, snap</i>—the lovely braids fell to the ground. Then, pitilessly, she took poor Rapunzel to a desert where she had to live in grief and misery.

        <item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, there was a great king of China. This king had everything he wanted: rare treasures, a beautiful palace, fine horses, the bravest warriors, and people who loved him. But there was one thing the king lacked—he didn’t have a wife.<br><br>

So one day, he gathered seven of his most trusted warriors, saddled his strongest horse, and departed in search of a wife. They traveled for many moons, visiting all the great palaces and cities along the way. Though they met many beautiful princesses and great ladies, nowhere did the king find a woman who made his heart beat faster.<br><br>

After a long day\'s ride, the party arrived at a lake, and the king decided to halt there and make camp for the night. As he was having supper, he heard the faint strains of a tune coming from the direction of the lake. He got up and walked toward the water. There, he saw a boat drifting by, carrying the figure of a woman. By the light of the moon, he saw her face and knew immediately that here was the woman he had set out to find.<br><br>

He called his warriors, and they waded into the water, pushing the craft to shore. The king helped the lady step onto the land and introduced himself. He invited her to join him for supper and soon stated the purpose of his quest. He asked if there was any reason why she could not travel back with him to his palace and be his wife.<br><br>

The woman was taken aback. "<b>You wish to marry me</b>?" she asked, "<b>when I am a complete stranger to you?</b>"<br><br>

The king was adamant. He declared that he had never seen a more comely woman with such fine features. She would make him proud if she consented to be his wife. He promised her a life of luxury, comfort, and maidservants to meet her every need, along with his undying devotion.<br><br>

The woman bowed her head and said, "<b>Yes, my king</b>. In that case, I shall be very happy to accept your offer of marriage."<br><br>

On the journey back to the palace, the king talked ceaselessly to his bride-to-be, but she said very little. She disclosed her name was <b>Jin-a</b> and that she had traveled far, though she did not reveal from where or why. The king noticed that she never once smiled, but he dismissed it, thinking the long journey had wearied her. Surely, once they returned to the palace, her mood would improve.<br><br>

The marriage took place days after their return, and the country celebrated for three days. The new queen took to her duties very well, impressing the entire court with her grace and demeanor. Yet, <b>Jin-a</b> still would not smile.<br><br>

The king asked if anything was wrong, but she always replied, "<b>Everything is perfect</b>. I could not be happier." The king tried everything to make her smile—jesters from distant lands, traveling performers, and even playful tricks on his courtiers and warriors—but all to no avail.<br><br>

One day, the king had an idea he believed would surely work. He instructed his most trusted courtier to burst into his private chambers that evening and announce that the enemy was at the gates, ready to attack the palace.<br><br>

That evening, as the king and queen were together in their bedroom—she brushing her hair, and he practicing calligraphy—the courtier burst in, disheveled and out of breath.<br><br>

"<b>Sire!</b>" he shouted, "<b>An army of foreign warriors is at the gate, preparing to fire their cannons!</b>"<br><br>

The king leapt up, scattering his ink and brushes. "<b>Where are my warriors?</b>" he cried. "<b>Where is my guard?</b>"<br><br>

The queen, seeing his frantic expression, suddenly burst out laughing. She covered her mouth with both hands, but the king was overjoyed. He jumped up and down, shook the courtier’s hand, and exclaimed, "<b>It worked! She laughed! At last, she laughed!</b>"<br><br>

He then confessed to his wife that it had all been a trick, and to his great relief, she smiled again at the revelation.<br><br>

The next day, however, the queen returned to her sad demeanor. The king tried every trick he knew, but nothing worked. Days passed, and the king himself became sad, believing that perhaps there was something in her past too painful to forget.<br><br>

One evening, as the queen read a book of poems, there was a sudden loud bang. The door burst open, and a courtier, out of breath and waving his arms, shouted:<br><br>

"<b>Sire! Sire! There is an army of foreign warriors at the gate! They are firing their cannons!</b>"<br><br>

The king shook his head and calmly approached the man. "<b>My good man,</b>" he said, "<b>you mean well, but it won’t work a second time.</b>"<br><br>

But the courtier insisted, "<b>No, sire, this time the enemy truly is here!</b>"<br><br>

The king stepped outside and heard the thunder of cannonballs smashing against the palace walls. He called out to his guards, but it was too late. Enemy warriors had already infiltrated the palace, killing everyone they came across. A group of them ran down the corridor and slew both the king and his loyal courtier.<br><br>

They spared <b>Jin-a</b>, and when the victorious warlord proclaimed himself the new king, he took her as his queen.<br><br>]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, a <b>woodcutter</b> lived at the edge of a great forest with his wife and their two children. They had a boy called <b>Hansel</b> and a girl called <b>Gretel</b>. The family’s house was very small—just a hut, really—and they were very poor. Often, they had to go to bed without any food. The woodcutter and his wife worried a great deal, and as time went by, their situation seemed to get worse and worse. There simply weren’t enough people who needed the woodsman’s services.
<br><br> <b>"How can we feed our children?"</b> the woodcutter lamented. <b>"We hardly have enough to feed ourselves."</b>
<br><br> His wife cried quietly. <b>"There’s nothing for it,"</b> she said. <b>"Tomorrow we’ll take them into the woods with us and lose them somehow. We just can’t carry on like this."</b> The woodcutter wasn’t happy with this plan.
<br><br> <b>"But what will happen to them? They’ll be in danger. Some wild animal might come along and eat them alive!"</b>
<br><br> But his wife had made up her mind. <b>"We have no choice. If we stay together, surely, we’ll all perish. At least if we don’t have their mouths to feed, we might stand a chance."</b> Quietly, her husband consented, knowing she was right but heartbroken at the thought.
<br><br> Hansel and Gretel, lying in their beds in the next room, had overheard everything. Gretel was terrified.
<br><br> <b>"Hansel,"</b> she cried, <b>"What are we going to do? Are we going to die?"</b>
<br><br> Hansel, a clever little boy, quickly formed a plan. <b>"Don’t worry, Gretel,"</b> he whispered. <b>"I’ll think of something. Just try to sleep and act normal tomorrow."</b>
<br><br> Later that night, while his parents slept, Hansel quietly crept outside and filled his pockets with small white pebbles.
<br><br> The next morning, at dawn, their mother woke them early. Their breakfast was only a little stale bread, but Hansel secretly kept his piece in his pocket. As they walked through the forest, Hansel dropped a pebble every few steps to mark the way home.
<br><br> When their parents left them alone by a fire, Hansel and Gretel eventually fell asleep. When they woke up in the middle of the night, Hansel took his sister’s hand. The moonlight guided them back home by following the white pebbles.
<br><br> Their father was overjoyed when they returned, though their mother was less pleased. For a time, they lived together peacefully, but soon, hunger returned. The cruel plan was made again, but this time the door was locked, and Hansel couldn’t collect pebbles.
<br><br> Instead, he used the stale bread, dropping crumbs along the path. However, when they tried to find their way back, the crumbs had been eaten by birds. Lost and wandering for days, they stumbled upon a strange house made of bread, cake, and candy.
<br><br> Suddenly, a croaky voice called out: <b>"Nibble, nibble, little mouse, who’s that eating at my house?"</b>
<br><br> An old witch emerged, seemingly kind, and invited them in with promises of food and soft beds. However, her kindness was a trick—Hansel was locked in a cage, and Gretel was forced to do endless chores. The witch planned to eat Hansel once he was fat enough.
<br><br> Clever Gretel devised a plan. She gave Hansel a small stick to offer instead of his finger when the witch checked his weight. The witch’s poor eyesight meant she didn’t notice the trick.
<br><br> Eventually, growing impatient, the witch ordered Gretel to light the oven. Pretending not to understand, Gretel tricked the witch into leaning inside the oven, and with all her strength, pushed the old woman in and slammed the door shut.
<br><br> Gretel freed Hansel, and they discovered the witch’s treasure—bags of gold coins and precious stones. They took as much as they could carry and, with the help of grateful birds, found their way home.
<br><br> Their father, heartbroken over their disappearance, was overjoyed to see them again. Their cruel stepmother was gone, and Hansel presented the gold they had found.
<br><br> With the treasure, their father built a beautiful new home, and they never knew hunger again.
<br><br> <b>Moral of the Story:</b>
<br><br> This story teaches us that <b>resourcefulness</b> and <b>bravery</b> can help overcome even the darkest situations. It also reminds us that <b>greed</b> and <b>cruelty</b> will eventually lead to downfall, while <b>kindness</b> and <b>family unity</b> will always prevail.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there lived an old <b>mother goat</b> in a pretty little cottage on the edge of the forest.

She called all her kids together to give them a little lecture on safety.
<br><br> <b>"Listen carefully, my dear children,"</b> she began. <b>"I need to go out to get some food, and I want you all to be very careful because I heard there is a wolf about.

<br><br> The wily old <b>wolf</b> must have been hiding behind a tree, watching the mother goat, because only a few minutes later, there was a loud knock on the door.
<br><br> <b>"Who’s there?"</b> shouted the oldest kid.
<br><br> <b>"Open the door!"</b> the wolf replied. <b>"It is your mother, and I’ve got some nice things for all of you!"</b>
<br><br> But the little goats heard the rough voice and knew this was not their mother.
<br><br> <b>"You’re not our mother!"</b> they cried. <b>"She has a sweet voice, and yours sounds rough and rotten. You must be the wolf, so go away!"</b>
<br><br> The wolf went away and thought about how he could disguise his voice. He visited the bees and bought a pint of honey, which he downed in one go to make his voice sweet. Then, he returned to the goats’ cottage and knocked on the door again.
<br><br> <b>"Open the door, my children,"</b> he called in a sweeter voice. <b>"It is I, your dear mother, and I’ve brought wonderful things for all of you to feast on!"</b>
<br><br> But the wolf made a mistake—he placed his great, black paws on the window, and the billy goats saw them.
<br><br> <b>"No, no, no!"</b> shouted the oldest billy goat. <b>"Our mother doesn’t have big black paws like that! Hers are dainty. You must be the wolf! We won’t open the door for you!"</b>
<br><br> The wolf went away again, thinking about how to disguise his paws. He had a brilliant idea and rushed to the <b>baker</b>, asking him to cover his paws with dough, pretending he had hurt his foot running from a hunter. Then, he went to the <b>miller</b> to ask for white flour to sprinkle on the dough.
<br><br> The miller, suspicious of the wolf’s intentions, hesitated. But the wolf growled fiercely.
<br><br> <b>"Give me the flour, or I’ll bite your nose off!"</b>
<br><br> Terrified, the miller handed over the flour, and the wolf covered his doughy paws.
<br><br> The wolf returned to the goats’ cottage and knocked again.
<br><br> <b>"Open the door, my dear little children! It is your mother, and I’ve brought something tasty for you!"</b>
<br><br> The oldest billy goat peeked out the window.
<br><br> <b>"Show us your feet, so we can see if you really are our mother,"</b> he said.
<br><br> The wolf showed his dough- and flour-covered paws.
<br><br> <b>"You see? It really is me, your mother,"</b> the wolf lied.
<br><br> Tricked at last, the goats unlocked the door. The wolf burst in, howling in his rough voice. The goats scrambled to hide, but one by one, the wolf found them all—except the youngest, who cleverly hid behind the grandfather clock.
<br><br> After gobbling up six of the kids, the wolf left, full and satisfied, to sleep under an apple tree.
<br><br> When the mother goat returned, she found the house in chaos and cried bitterly. But then she heard a soft voice:
<br><br> <b>"Mummy, is that you?"</b>
<br><br> She found her youngest child hiding and learned everything that had happened. They hurried outside and found the wolf snoring under the tree. The mother goat noticed movement in his belly and guessed her children might still be alive.
<br><br> Quickly, she fetched a pair of scissors and cut open the wolf’s stomach. Out jumped her six kids—alive and unharmed!
<br><br> To teach the wolf a lesson, they filled his stomach with heavy stones and sewed him back up.
<br><br> When the wolf awoke, he felt unusually heavy and thirsty. He stumbled to the brook for a drink, but the weight of the stones dragged him down into the water, and he drowned.
<br><br> The mother goat and her seven little billy goats rejoiced. They cleaned the house and threw a big party with the treats their mother had brought from the forest.
<br><br> <b>Moral of the Story:</b>
<br><br> This story teaches us that <b>cleverness</b>, <b>caution</b>, and <b>bravery</b> are essential to overcoming danger. It also reminds us that <b>deception</b> and <b>greed</b> will ultimately lead to downfall, while <b>love</b> and <b>family unity</b> will always prevail.]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[In a faraway kingdom, there lived two girls, <b>Rosie</b> and <b>Daisy</b>. <b>Daisy</b> was the elder sister, and <b>Rosie</b> was the younger. They lived in a castle as princesses. <b>Daisy</b> was mean and selfish. She loved to hurt everyone, including her sister, but she was kind to her father, the king, because she believed he would hand over the kingdom to her in the future. On the other hand, <b>Rosie</b> was kind, loving, and helpful. She never complained to her father.

<br><br>

One day, the king decided to divide the kingdom into two equal halves for his daughters. He asked <b>Daisy</b>, "What is it that you like the most in the whole world?" <b>Daisy</b> thought if she mentioned pearls or jewels, her father might be displeased and give the whole kingdom to <b>Rosie</b>. Instead, she lied, "Daddy, of course, it’s you!"

<br><br>

When it was <b>Rosie’s</b> turn, she smiled and said, "Oh! Daddy, there are millions of things that I like. But the best ones are rain, rainbows, smiling babies, helping others, and seeing people happy." The king’s face turned red with anger. He punished <b>Rosie</b> by asking her to leave the kingdom for a week.

<br><br>

<b>Rosie</b> left the castle feeling very sad. As she walked, she heard someone sobbing. It was a coconut tree. When she asked why it was crying, the tree explained that no one had watered it for days and it might die. <b>Rosie</b> said, "Don’t worry, my friend. I will help you." She dug a small canal from a nearby lake to the tree so it could be watered constantly. The tree was immensely grateful and thanked her.

<br><br>

Further along, she saw a cow and calf crying. The calf said, "My mum hasn’t had hay for days. If this continues, she won’t be able to feed me, and I will starve. Our master isn’t here to help." <b>Rosie</b> comforted them, found hay, and brought back enough to last until the owner returned. The cow and calf thanked her sincerely.

<br><br>

Soon, she heard tiny voices crying and realized they were ants whose anthill had been destroyed by heavy rain. <b>Rosie</b> collected mud and helped them rebuild their home. The ants were overjoyed and thanked her.

<br><br>

After a long journey, she found a hut in a forest and knocked on the door. An old lady answered. <b>Rosie</b> asked if she could rest and offered to do all the housework in return. The old lady kindly agreed and gave her food. <b>Rosie</b> didn’t mention she was a princess because she didn’t want special treatment. She worked hard for a week.

<br><br>

When <b>Rosie</b> was about to leave, she asked for some shampoo, soap, and a dress. The old woman gave her everything she asked for and gifted her a box, instructing her to open it only in her room.

<br><br>

On her way back, the ants gave her gems and jewels. The cow’s owner, now returned, gave her milk and sweets and arranged for her gifts to be delivered to the castle. The grateful coconut tree gave her special coconuts, whispering, "Open these only in your room."

<br><br>

When <b>Rosie</b> returned home, her father barely recognized her because of her glowing beauty. Excited, she opened her gifts. The jewels sparkled brightly, and every time she took one, it was replaced by another. When she opened the coconuts, gold coins poured out endlessly. <b>Rosie</b> asked her father to share the wealth with the entire kingdom.

<br><br>

<b>Daisy</b>, burning with jealousy, decided to follow the same path. However, when she came across the coconut tree, cow and calf, and ants, she refused to help them and treated them cruelly.

<br><br>

When <b>Daisy</b> reached the old woman’s house, she demanded special treatment and refused to help. The old woman gave her gifts anyway, but on her journey back, the ants bit her, the cow and calf kicked her, and the coconut tree threw coconuts at her.

<br><br>

Near the castle, she opened her gift early, only to be attacked by bees and find weeds inside the box. When she reached home, her father didn’t recognize her because she had lost her beauty. <b>Daisy</b> confessed everything and promised to change. She learned her lesson, and the family lived happily ever after.

She used to wear flip-flops until one day she stubbed her toe, and the tip came off. After that, she started wearing slippers to hide her toe.

<br><br>

She found the slippers at a thrift store for $2.65 plus tax. She also found a nightgown for $1.99, which she wore everywhere—even to <b>Walmart</b>. One day, on her way into Walmart, the door greeter complimented her yellow slippers and asked where she got them. She proudly claimed she had purchased them at an auction for <b>$6,000</b> because they once belonged to <b>Whoopi Goldberg</b>. Yes, Gertrude was not only a snob but also a pathological liar. Her personality was about as unattractive as her name.

<br><br>

As she continued toward the produce department, she got her usual load of <b>mini cucumbers</b> (she loved making pickles). She also picked up some <b>olive loaf, a new set of toenail clippers, Dr. Scholl’s foot powder, onions, a few cans of beans, air freshener,</b> and <b>toilet paper</b>.

<br><br>

Gertrude had grown so accustomed to people admiring her shoes that she became conceited. She truly believed she was better than everyone else—especially since everyone thought Whoopi Goldberg had once owned her slippers and that she had paid top dollar for them.

<br><br>

When she returned home, she proudly told Maya, "I scolded your teacher nicely for punishing you without reason!" Then she asked, "By the way, Maya, what was it that you didn’t do?"

<br><br>

One day, the Brahmin left for a neighboring village to collect a gift that had been promised to him by a rich landlord. After receiving his gift—a fat and healthy <b>goat</b>—he set off for home, carrying it on his shoulders.

<br><br>

Along the way, three <b>hungry crooks</b> saw the healthy goat and whispered among themselves, "That is a very plump goat. Let us trick the Brahmin and take it away. We can then make a tasty dish out of it."

<br><br>

They quickly came up with a plan and split up.

<br><br>

The first crook approached the Brahmin and exclaimed in horror, "Oh my God! Such a respected priest carrying a <b>dog</b> on his shoulders? Don’t you know that it is a sin to touch a dog, a rooster, or a donkey?"

<br><br>

The Brahmin lost his temper. "You stupid fellow! Are you blind? Can’t you see this is a goat, not a dog?"

<br><br>

"Don’t be angry," replied the first crook. "If you think it is not a dog, then please carry on. But isn’t it ridiculous that you are carrying a dog?"

<br><br>

The Brahmin ignored him and walked on. After a few yards, the second crook stopped him and looked at him in shock.

<br><br>

"How can a reputed priest like you carry a <b>dead calf</b> on your shoulders?" he exclaimed.

<br><br>

The Brahmin yelled, "Are you blind too? This is a healthy and live goat, and you say it is a dead calf? You are an ignorant fool!"

<br><br>

"All right, sir," said the second crook. "Please forgive me. Do as you please."

<br><br>

The Brahmin grew furious and muttered to himself, "What’s wrong with everyone? Has the whole world gone mad?"

<br><br>

As he continued towards his home, the third crook blocked his path and said, "Sir, why are you carrying a <b>donkey</b> on your shoulders? It will bring you misfortune."

<br><br>

Now the Brahmin was <b>confused</b>. Three different people had told him that the goat was something else.

<br><br>

"Have I been given a ghost that keeps changing into a dog, a dead calf, or a donkey?" he wondered. "I don’t want this creature!"

<br><br>

Terrified, he threw the goat to the ground and ran away as fast as he could.

<br><br>

The crooks came out of hiding, grabbed the goat, and laughed at the Brahmin’s foolishness. By blindly believing others, he had been tricked.

        <item><![CDATA[Once, there lived a goat named <b>Angus</b>. He stayed with his owners, <b>Mr. and Mrs. Douglas</b>, who pampered him like a baby. However, Angus had a bad habit—he loved chewing woolen clothes, much to the dismay of his owners. They often scolded him for it.

<br><br>

One morning, Mr. and Mrs. Douglas had to go to the market. Before leaving, they hung <b>Mr. Douglas’ favorite woolen jacket</b> on the clothesline.

<br><br>

"Angus, don’t chew the jacket," warned the Douglases before heading out.

<br><br>

Shortly after they left, it began to pour heavily.

<br><br>

"Oh no! The coat is getting wet! I must pull it down," thought Angus.

<br><br>

However, the moment he pulled it down, his old habit kicked in, and before he knew it, he was happily <b>chewing</b> the coat.

<br><br>

When the rain stopped, Angus realized what he had done.

<br><br>

"Oh no," he thought in panic. "This time they will throw me out of the house!"

<br><br>

He decided to keep quiet about it.

<br><br>

When the Douglases returned, Mr. Douglas looked around and asked, "Has the wind blown away my coat?"

<br><br>

Angus quickly <b>nodded</b>, pretending to know nothing.

<br><br>

However, Mrs. Douglas suddenly noticed a small <b>strand of wool</b> sticking to Angus’ chin.

<br><br>

"Why! This is jacket wool!" she screamed.

<br><br>

"So you’re the culprit!" Mr. Douglas confirmed.

<br><br>

Poor Angus had to go without <b>lunch and dinner</b> as punishment. From that day on, he swore never to chew wool again.

However, as soon as he got close, the unbearable stench from the pig made him step back. Unable to tolerate the foul smell, the lion turned away and left without drinking.

<br><br>

The <b>foolish pig</b>, unaware of the real reason, thought that the lion had run away in fear of him. Feeling proud, he excitedly <b>challenged</b> the lion to a duel.

<br><br>

"Maybe tomorrow," replied the lion, uninterested, and walked away from the smelly pig.

<br><br>

That evening, the pig rushed home and eagerly told his parents, "I challenged a cowardly lion today, and he ran away from me!"

<br><br>

Hearing this, his father shook his head and said, "What have you done, you foolish pig? The lion didn’t fear you—he feared your awful stench!"

<br><br>

The pig’s excitement instantly <b>crashed</b>.

<br><br>

His father then cleverly suggested, "If you want to keep the lion away, you should roll in the dirty waters even more, so you stink even worse before facing him again."

<br><br>

The pig listened to his father’s advice. The next day, when the lion approached, an even <b>fouler smell</b> spread through the air. The lion, once again, could not bear it and ran away.

<br><br>

Since then, pigs have always kept themselves dirty, ensuring that no animal dares to come near them.

<br><br>

One day, a man was walking through a dense forest. Feeling tired, he sat under a tree to rest.

<br><br>

Nearby, there were some bushes. Suddenly, he heard a <b>whistle</b> coming from within them. Curious, he got up and went to investigate. Under a bush, he found an old bottle, and to his surprise, the whistle seemed to be coming from inside it.

<br><br>

The man cautiously <b>opened</b> the bottle to look inside. The moment he did, a thick cloud of <b>black smoke</b> emerged and rose high into the sky. Slowly, the smoke transformed into a massive ghost—so tall that he reached the treetops!

<br><br>

The ghost had <b>red skin</b>, <b>fiery red eyes</b>, and large <b>golden earrings</b> in his ears. He let out a thunderous roar and said, "Give me work, or I shall eat you up!"

<br><br>

The man was terrified. "W-what kind of work do you want?" he stammered.

<br><br>

"Any kind of work," the ghost replied. "You have released me from the bottle, so now you must keep me busy, day and night. The moment you stop giving me work, I will eat you!"

<br><br>

Thinking quickly, the man said, "Take me to my house."

<br><br>

In an instant, the ghost grabbed the man and flew to his house. As soon as they arrived, the ghost demanded, "Give me more work, or I shall eat you up!"

<br><br>

"Build me a grand palace," the man ordered.

<br><br>

In just a few minutes, the palace was ready.

<br><br>

"Give me more work, or I shall eat you up!" the ghost repeated.

<br><br>

"Bring me plenty of gold and jewels," the man commanded.

<br><br>

At once, the ghost brought mountains of gold and sparkling jewels. But he still demanded more work.

<br><br>

The man kept giving him tasks—new clothes, delicious food, and more. But no matter how much work the ghost did, he always came back, saying, "Give me more work, or I shall eat you up!"

<br><br>

The man soon became exhausted. He had no time to eat, no time to sleep. He knew he had to think of a way to get rid of the ghost.

<br><br>

Suddenly, an idea struck him.

<br><br>

"Make me a tall pillar, as high as the sky," he said. "And be quick!"

<br><br>

In just a few minutes, the ghost returned. "The pillar is ready!" he said. "Now, give me more work, or I shall eat you up!"

<br><br>

The man smiled and said, "Listen carefully. Climb to the top of the pillar, then climb down to the ground. Keep going up and down, without stopping, until I tell you to stop. And don’t waste any time!"

<br><br>

The ghost, excited to have endless work, eagerly obeyed. He climbed up and down, up and down, without stopping.

<br><br>

The man watched for a while, then went inside, ate his food, and finally got some sleep.

<br><br>

The next morning, he stepped outside and saw the ghost still climbing up and down the pillar. The man was pleased.

<br><br>

Days passed, then weeks, then months. The ghost never stopped.

<br><br>

After one month, the ghost felt tired. "Sir, may I stop now? I have been going up and down for so long," he pleaded.

<br><br>

"No," said the man. "You cannot stop until I say so. Keep climbing!"

<br><br>

Another three months passed. The ghost was now <b>exhausted.</b>

<br><br>

"Sir, I can’t do it anymore," he cried. "Please, let me stop!"

<br><br>

The man thought for a moment and then said, "You can stop on one condition: you must leave this place forever and never return!"

<br><br>

"I promise!" the ghost said eagerly.

<br><br>

"Very well," the man agreed. "You may stop now. But take the pillar with you!"

<br><br>

The ghost wasted no time. He picked up the pillar and <b>ran away</b>, never to be seen again.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the story:</b> Intelligence and quick thinking are more powerful than strength. A sharp mind can defeat even the strongest enemy.

<br><br>

A rich man lived in a small town in Tamil Nadu. One day, he brought home two large and juicy mangoes. He handed them to his servant and said, "Here, Ramu, take these to the kitchen and cut them. Also, make two cups of coffee. A friend of mine will be arriving soon. Prepare the mangoes and coffee when he comes."

<br><br>

Ramu took the mangoes to the kitchen and began cutting them with a knife. To make sure they weren’t sour, he popped a piece into his mouth. "Ah, how sweet it tastes!" he thought. "If I eat just one more piece, the master will never notice."

<br><br>

One more piece… then another… and another. In just a few minutes, the plate was empty!

<br><br>

Ramu suddenly realized what he had done. "Oh no! The master will surely beat me." Just then, he heard his master calling, "Ramu, have you cut the mangoes? Keep the coffee ready too. My friend will be here any minute."

<br><br>

Poor Ramu! What was he to do now? He had already eaten the mangoes. Thinking quickly, he came up with an idea.

<br><br>

"Oh, master," he replied, "the knife is too blunt. I can’t cut the mangoes with it."

<br><br>

"You fool!" the master shouted. "Why didn’t you tell me earlier? Bring the knife here, and I’ll sharpen it for you."

<br><br>

Ramu rushed to the kitchen, grabbed a large, blunt knife, and handed it to his master. While the master was busy sharpening it, Ramu quietly slipped out of the house.

<br><br>

Down the road, he saw his master’s friend approaching. Ramu ran to him and cried, "Sir! Sir! Have you had a fight with my master? He says he will cut off both your ears!"

<br><br>

The friend looked shocked. "A fight? No, we didn’t really fight. But yesterday, when he visited my house, I accidentally wore his chappals by mistake. Why would he want to cut off my ears for something so small?"

<br><br>

"I’m telling you, sir, he’s really angry! He is sharpening a big knife right now," Ramu warned. "If you don’t believe me, you can see for yourself. But be careful—don’t let him catch you!"

<br><br>

Curious but nervous, the friend crept up to an open window and peered inside. He saw the rich man intensely sharpening a large knife.

<br><br>

"My goodness!" he gasped. "He really wants to cut off my ears! I must run away before he sees me!"

<br><br>

Terrified, he turned and sprinted back the way he had come.

<br><br>

Meanwhile, Ramu rushed back to his master, crying, "Master! Master! Your friend has taken both the mangoes. Look, there he is, running away!"

<br><br>

The master looked up and saw his friend fleeing at full speed. Furious, he ran after him, shouting, "Stop! Stop! Keep one if you like, but at least give me the other one!"

<br><br>

Hearing this, the friend glanced back and saw the rich man chasing him—holding a big knife in one hand!

<br><br>

"He’s really going to cut off my ears!" he screamed, doubling his speed. In no time, he vanished into the distance.

<br><br>

The master soon gave up the chase and returned home. He called for Ramu and said, "I never knew how greedy this man was! And a thief too! Thank you for telling me."

<br><br>

Then, he went inside and brought out two more large and juicy mangoes. Handing them to Ramu, he said, "Here, Ramu. You eat one, and cut the other one for me."

In a small village in <b>Himachal Pradesh</b>, a state in the northern hilly region of India, lived an old man and his wife. Both were over seventy and deeply loved each other. The village was tiny, home to only five other families.

<br><br>

One cold winter evening, as the snow fell outside, the old man and his wife sat inside their warm hut. Suddenly, the old man looked up and said, <b>"I wish we had some pakoras. I’m really craving them today."</b>

<br><br>

His wife smiled and replied, <b>"Let me check if we have any besan (gram flour)."</b> She got up, opened the tin, and sighed. <b>"There’s only a little left,"</b> she said. <b>"It’s too cold to go out and buy more. But I’ll make pakoras with whatever we have."</b>

<br><br>

She lit the fire and carefully made five pakoras. Placing them on a plate, she handed three to her husband and kept two for herself.

<br><br>

However, the old man refused to take them. <b>"How can I eat three while you only have two?"</b> he said. <b>"Take one from me."</b>

<br><br>

His wife shook her head. <b>"Two are enough for me,"</b> she insisted. <b>"You were the one who wanted pakoras, so you should have three. Tomorrow, I’ll buy more besan and make pakoras again. Then I’ll take one extra."</b>

<br><br>

<b>"We’ll talk about tomorrow when it comes,"</b> the old man replied. <b>"But today, you must eat three."</b>

<br><br>

The couple continued to argue over the pakoras, neither willing to eat more than the other. The night passed, but they still hadn’t eaten. Finally, they agreed on a plan. <b>"It’s too late now,"</b> they decided. <b>"Let’s go to sleep. Tomorrow morning, whoever wakes up first will eat three pakoras."</b>

<br><br>

With that, they both went to bed.

<br><br>

The next morning arrived, but neither of them got up. They lay in bed with their eyes closed, each hoping the other would wake up first. The sun rose high in the sky, yet they remained in bed.

<br><br>

The neighbors began to worry. <b>"What’s wrong with the old couple?"</b> they wondered. <b>"They haven’t come out yet. Let’s check on them."</b>

<br><br>

They knocked on the door—no response. They called out—still nothing. Growing anxious, they pounded on the door with their fists. But the hut remained silent.

<br><br>

Now truly alarmed, one of the neighbors said, <b>"We must break the door. What if something has happened to them?"</b>

<br><br>

Grabbing an axe, they smashed open the door and rushed inside, only to find the old man and his wife lying motionless on their cots.

<br><br>

<b>"Oh no,"</b> one of them gasped. <b>"They’re both dead! We must take them to the burning place."</b>

<br><br>

Hearing this, the old man jolted up in alarm. Realizing they were about to be burned alive, he shouted, <b>"Oh, very well! I’ll eat three, and you can have the other two!"</b>

<br><br>

At this, the old woman shot up as well. <b>"That’s what I’ve been telling you all along!"</b> she cried. <b>"If only you had listened last night, we wouldn’t have gone hungry!"</b>

<br><br>

The neighbors, witnessing this sudden "resurrection," screamed in terror. <b>"Ghosts! Ghosts!"</b> they shrieked. <b>"The ghosts of the old man and his wife are after us! The old man’s ghost will eat three families, and his wife’s ghost will eat the other two!"</b>

<br><br>

Fearing for their lives, the neighbors bolted from the hut.

<br><br>

The old couple was bewildered. They ran after the neighbors, trying to explain, but this only made things worse. The villagers, convinced they were being chased by ghosts, ran even faster.

<br><br>

It took a long time for the old couple to convince them of the truth. When the neighbors finally heard the full story, they burst into laughter.

<br><br>

That very day, the old woman bought more <b>besan</b> from the shop and made plenty of pakoras. She invited everyone in the village to a grand feast. After all, she felt sorry for giving them such a fright!

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
Love is about sharing and caring, but sometimes, unnecessary arguments over small matters can lead to big misunderstandings!

<b>The Man, His Horse, and the Coconuts</b>
One day, a man who had been out gathering <b>coconuts</b> loaded his horse heavily with the fruit. As he made his way home, he met a young boy on the road.

<br><br>

He asked the boy, <b>"How long will it take me to reach my house?"</b>

<br><br>

The boy looked at the heavily burdened horse and replied, <b>"If you go slowly, you will arrive very soon; but if you go fast, it will take you all day."</b>

<br><br>

The man was puzzled by this strange response. <b>"How can going faster take longer?"</b> he thought. Ignoring the boy’s words, he hurried his horse.

<br><br>

But as the horse moved faster, the <b>coconuts</b> began to fall off. He had to stop, pick them up, and reload them onto the horse.

<br><br>

Determined to make up for lost time, he urged his horse to go even faster. However, the <b>coconuts</b> fell off once again.

<br><br>

This happened repeatedly, and what should have been a quick journey turned into an exhausting task. By the time he finally reached home, it was already night.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
Haste makes waste. Sometimes, patience and steady effort will get you to your goal faster than rushing and making mistakes.

<item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there was a <b>king</b> who lived in a beautiful <b>palace</b> near a forest. He had several beautiful daughters.

<br><br>

There was a <b>lake</b> at some distance from the palace. During the summer, the youngest princess often sat near the lake and sometimes played there with a <b>golden ball</b>.

<br><br>

One day, while playing with her ball, it accidentally fell into the lake. The princess started crying. Seeing her weep, a <b>frog</b> nearby asked, "What’s the matter, O princess? Why are you crying?"

<br><br>

The princess was surprised to hear a voice. She looked around and noticed a frog peeping out of the water. She said, "O frog, my ball has fallen into the lake. I don’t know how to get it back. Please help me retrieve it."

<br><br>

The frog laughed and said, "Oh! Is this why you’re crying? Don’t worry, I will help you."

<br><br>

After thinking for a moment, the frog added, "But tell me, what will you give me in return for bringing your ball back?"

<br><br>

The princess said, "Dear friend, I will give you anything you ask for—jewelry, pearls, or even my <b>golden crown</b>."

<br><br>

The frog replied, "I don’t want any of those things. I only want your <b>true friendship</b>. I wish to share your lunch and dinner and be a good friend to you. If you agree, I will bring back your ball."

<br><br>

The princess eagerly agreed, saying, "I accept your proposal. Now, please bring my ball quickly." In her heart, she thought, "This frog must be mad to want to be friends with me."

<br><br>

The frog dived into the water and soon brought out the ball. The princess, overjoyed, grabbed the ball and ran back to the palace, ignoring the frog’s pleas to take him along.

<br><br>

The next day, as the princess sat at the dining table with her father and sisters, she heard a knock at the door. A voice called out, "O princess! Please open the door. I have come after much trouble."

<br><br>

Startled, the princess opened the door and was shocked to see the frog. Frightened, she quickly closed the door and returned to the dining table.

<br><br>

Seeing her disturbed, the king asked, "What’s the matter? Is someone trying to harm you?"

<br><br>

The princess replied, "No, father. There’s neither an enemy nor anyone trying to hurt me. It’s just an ugly frog trying to enter the palace."

<br><br>

The king asked, "Why has the frog come here?" The princess explained everything that had happened by the lake and confessed to making a promise to the frog.

<br><br>

The frog knocked again. The king said, "Dear princess, you must keep your promise. Bring the frog inside with respect."

<br><br>

Reluctantly, the princess let the frog in. The frog asked, "Let me sit beside you." The king reminded her to honor her word, so she allowed the frog to sit next to her and served him food as he desired. While the frog ate happily, the princess could barely eat.

<br><br>

After dinner, the frog requested to sleep in her bedroom. Horrified, the princess cried, "How can an ugly, dirty frog sleep with me?"

<br><br>

Her father reminded her, "Dear, a promise must never be broken. If someone helps you in your time of need, you should honor their kindness."

<br><br>

The princess had no choice but to take the frog to her bedroom. Once inside, the frog whispered, "Take me to your bed, or I will tell your father."

<br><br>

Angry and disgusted, the princess lost her temper. She picked up the frog and threw him against the wall. But as soon as the frog hit the wall, he transformed into a handsome prince.

<br><br>

Stunned, the princess calmed down and instantly fell in love with him. The prince then explained, "I was cursed by a witch and could only break the spell through an act of true friendship. Forgive me if I seemed rude, but it was the only way to break the curse."

<br><br>

Soon, the princess and the prince got married, and the king gave them his blessings. The prince then took his bride to his own kingdom, where they lived happily ever after.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the story:</b> A promise is a promise—always honor your commitments, and kindness will be rewarded.

<item><![CDATA[<b>Meethu</b> was a beautiful green parrot with a striking <b>red beak</b> that made him look even more attractive. He had built his nest within the bushy branches of a large <b>peepal tree</b> in a peaceful village. Every day, Meethu would leave his nest in the morning in search of food and return by evening to spend the night comfortably.

<br><br>

One day, while flying in search of food, Meethu spotted a mango tree laden with ripe, juicy yellow mangoes.

<br><br>

"Oh! What delicious mangoes!" he exclaimed, his mouth watering at the sight. He quickly flew down and perched on a branch, ready to feast on the juicy fruit.

<br><br>

Just as he was about to take a bite, a harsh voice interrupted him, "Hey! Who are you? This is <b>my tree</b>!" Startled, Meethu looked around and saw a black crow glaring at him. "My name is <b>Kaura</b>. I said, go away from here!" the crow warned.

<br><br>

Frightened by the aggressive crow, Meethu flew away, disappointed that he couldn’t taste the sweet mangoes. On his way back home, he noticed a red balloon lying in a garden. Suddenly, an idea struck Meethu’s clever mind.

<br><br>

He picked up the balloon with his beak and flew back toward the mango tree. Quietly and cautiously, he approached the tree and bit the balloon with his sharp beak. The balloon burst with a loud <b>BOOM</b>!

<br><br>

Terrified by the sudden noise, Kaura the crow panicked and shouted, "It must be a hunter around! He’s going to kill me! I must get out of here!"

<br><br>

The frightened crow quickly flew away from the tree and never returned. Meethu, pleased with his clever trick, finally enjoyed the sweet, juicy mangoes without any disturbance. From that day on, he ate as many mangoes as he wanted, enjoying his victory over the greedy crow.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the story:</b> Clever thinking and smart solutions can help overcome even the most difficult problems. ]]></item>
<item><![CDATA[Long, long ago, there was a <b>beautiful palace</b> in the middle of <b>Baghdad city</b>. The building was surrounded by <b>lush orchards</b>, and soothing music played in the background, creating a peaceful atmosphere. The palace was so attractive that whoever saw it could not help but praise its beauty. There was no other building in Baghdad as magnificent in <b>splendor and charm</b>.

<br><br>

One day, a <b>poor man</b> happened to come across the palace. He was amazed by its grandeur and thought, <i>“The building looks beautiful from the outside; it must be even more attractive inside. But how can I see the interior of the palace?”</i>

<br><br>

He was shabbily dressed and hesitated to enter. Just then, he noticed some people going inside. Thinking no one would notice him in the crowd, he decided to blend in. At the gate, the <b>owner</b> of the palace warmly welcomed the guests, asking, <i>“I hope you didn’t face any difficulty reaching here?”</i> The guests thanked him for his hospitality and discussed various business matters in the auditorium.

<br><br>

The poor man hid behind a pillar, listening to the conversation. He soon realized the owner was a <b>very wealthy man</b>.

<br><br>

After some time, the poor man explored another part of the building. He was shocked to see even the <b>dogs</b> eating from <b>golden plates</b>. When fresh meat was served, one dog didn’t touch it and instead looked kindly at the poor man, as if inviting him to eat.

<br><br>

The hungry man quickly ate to his satisfaction and thought, <i>“Should I take this golden plate? If I do, I can start a business and become rich.”</i> Fearing the dog might attack him, he looked into its eyes and only saw <b>kindness and sympathy</b>.

<br><br>

He picked up the plate, and to his relief, the dog remained still. Stealthily, he left the palace unnoticed. Once outside, he thought, <i>“I should leave Baghdad. It would be dangerous to stay here. I’ll move to a small town and start my business there.”</i>

<br><br>

He settled in another city and soon became wealthy. Though his hardships had ended, he constantly thought, <i>“I owe a debt to the owner of that beautiful palace. I must repay it.”</i>

<br><br>

So, he loaded valuable gifts onto camels and returned to Baghdad. However, upon arriving, he was shocked to find the <b>palace in ruins</b>. Searching for the owner, he met an <b>old man</b> wandering near the ruins.

<br><br>

The businessman asked, <i>“There used to be a beautiful palace here. Do you know what happened to its owner?”</i> The old man replied, <i>“Yes, that palace is now in ruins. Fate is unpredictable.”</i>

<br><br>

The businessman revealed his story, explaining how he had stolen a golden plate from the palace and became rich using that wealth. He offered the old man his valuable gifts in gratitude. However, the old man refused, saying, <i>“The <b>dog</b> showed you kindness, not me. I won’t accept anything.”</i>

<br><br>

Feeling sorry for the old man\'s misfortune, the businessman thought, <i>“Fate had given him a golden opportunity to rebuild his fortune, but he let it slip away. Life knocks at everyone’s door once; it’s up to us to recognize and seize that moment.”</i>

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
Opportunities often come disguised in unexpected ways. Recognizing and acting upon them can change your life forever. Be grateful for the kindness you receive, and never hesitate to repay it when the chance arises.

<item><![CDATA[<b>Once upon a time</b>, there was a king named <b>Firoz Shah</b>, who ruled over <b>Kashmir</b>. One day, while his wife was sitting near a window, she noticed a woman selling fish. Curious, the queen asked the woman if she had any <b>female fish</b>. The fish-seller replied, <i>"No, I have only male fish."</i>

<br><br>

As the woman moved ahead, the queen suddenly heard the sound of a fish laughing. Shocked and confused, she thought, <i>"Is the fish laughing at me?"</i> Annoyed by the incident, she rushed to the king and narrated the entire event.

<br><br>

The king was puzzled and summoned his <b>Prime Minister, Hussain</b>, who was known for his intelligence. The king explained the situation and ordered Hussain to solve the mystery within <b>fifteen days</b>, warning him that failure would result in beheading.

<br><br>

The next day, Hussain set out on a journey to unravel the riddle. Along the way, he met an <b>old farmer</b> named <b>Rehman</b>, who was traveling to <b>Pahalgam</b>. Hussain decided to befriend him, hoping he might help solve the mystery.

<br><br>

During their journey, Hussain made cryptic remarks like, <i>"It would be better for us to take each other alternately."</i> Rehman didn\'t understand but remained silent. Later, as they passed a maize field, Hussain asked if they could eat from it. Again, Rehman was puzzled. When they entered a village where no one welcomed them, Hussain remarked, <i>"What are we doing in this graveyard?"</i> Rehman was confused but kept quiet.

<br><br>

Eventually, they reached a <b>graveyard</b> where food was being distributed in memory of someone\'s ancestors. Hussain commented, <i>"Oh! What a good village this is!"</i> Rehman now thought Hussain was mad and left him to return home.

<br><br>

At home, Rehman shared the odd behavior of Hussain with his intelligent daughter, <b>Johra</b>. She explained that Hussain\'s cryptic remarks had deeper meanings:

    The alternate journey suggestion meant sharing stories to pass the time.
    Not eating maize reflected respect for the owner\'s absence.
    The village was like a graveyard because no one welcomed them, while the graveyard felt like a village due to the hospitality shown there.

<br><br>

Realizing Hussain\'s wisdom, Rehman invited him to stay at their home. Johra eagerly asked Hussain about his journey\'s purpose. Hussain explained the king\'s riddle and the danger to his life if he failed.

<br><br>

Johra quickly solved the mystery: <i>"The laughing fish indicates a conspiracy. Someone disguised as a woman plans to assassinate the king."</i> Hussain agreed and returned to the palace with Johra and Rehman.

<br><br>

Hussain presented Johra\'s theory to the king, who asked how to prove it. Hussain suggested testing the maids. A large pit was dug, and the maids were asked to jump across it. All failed except one, revealing the disguised assassin.

<br><br>

The king had the <b>spy</b> arrested and rewarded Johra generously. In recognition of her intelligence, Hussain married Johra, and they lived happily ever after.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
Wisdom and intelligence can solve even the deepest mysteries, and help often comes from the most unexpected places.

<item><![CDATA[<b>Long ago</b>, there lived a wealthy trader named <b>Sripad</b>. Through his hard work and determination, he amassed immense wealth and had everything a man could desire in his house.

<br><br>

One day, Sripad set out on a trade journey. While passing through a dense forest, he grew tired and decided to rest under a large tree. As he sat down, he felt thirsty and wished, <i>“If only I had some water to quench my thirst!”</i>

<br><br>

Incredibly, as soon as he made this wish, a pitcher of water appeared before him. Delighted, he quenched his thirst and felt refreshed.

<br><br>

A little later, hunger struck him. Sripad thought, <i>“If only I had a plate of delicious food right now, I would be so lucky!”</i> Immediately, a plate full of tasty dishes appeared before him. He ate to his heart’s content and felt completely satisfied.

<br><br>

After such a hearty meal, drowsiness overtook him. He murmured, <i>“How can I sleep on this rough ground? If only I had a soft bed to rest on!”</i> To his amazement, a colorful velvet bed appeared before him.

<br><br>

Sripad lay down on the soft bed, unaware that the tree under which he rested was no ordinary tree—it was a <b>Kalpavriksha</b>, a magical tree believed to fulfill any wish.

<br><br>

He enjoyed a peaceful sleep, but upon waking, his thoughts took a dark turn. He began to worry, <i>“I am all alone in this forest, surrounded by wild animals like lions, tigers, and wolves. What if one of them comes and kills me?”</i>

<br><br>

Unfortunately, as soon as he thought this, a ferocious tiger appeared out of nowhere. Terrified, Sripad couldn’t even react, and the tiger attacked and killed him.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
Our thoughts shape our reality. Positive thinking leads to positive outcomes, while negative thoughts can attract negativity. Therefore, always nurture a positive mindset to lead a happy and fulfilling life.

<item><![CDATA[Long ago, in the renowned city of <b>Taxila</b>, there lived a learned Brahmin named <b>Shivdutt</b>. A great scholar of the <b>Vedas</b> and other ancient texts, he had defeated many intellectuals in theological debates. His closest friend, <b>Namdev</b>, was equally wise and respected.<br><br>

One day, Namdev proposed,<br>

    “Let’s visit <b>Patliputra</b>, the city of scholars, and test our wisdom.”<br><br>

Shivdutt agreed, eager to measure their knowledge against the best minds of the time.<br><br>

<b>Encounters with Hidden Wisdom</b><br><br>

On their journey, they reached a river near Patliputra and met a woman washing clothes. They asked,<br>

    “We are travelers unfamiliar with this place. Where should we stay?”<br><br>

The woman cryptically replied,<br>

    “Lions live in the forest, fish in water, birds in their nests, and a king in his palace. But where travelers stay, I do not know.”<br><br>

Surprised by her wit, they realized that Patliputra was full of hidden wisdom.<br><br>

Soon after, they saw a child crying next to a plate of delicious food. Puzzled, they remarked,<br>

    “Why is this foolish child crying despite having food before him?”<br><br>

The boy chuckled and answered,<br>

    “I am not foolish. Crying clears the throat and improves digestion.”<br><br>

Realizing the boy’s cleverness, Namdev warned,<br>

    “We must be careful; this city is full of scholars.”<br><br>

<b>The Intelligent Kalavati</b><br><br>

Next, they encountered a girl picking mangoes from a tree. Namdev requested,<br>

    “We’ve traveled a long way. Could you give us some mangoes?”<br><br>

The girl responded,<br>

    “Do you want hot or cold mangoes?”<br><br>

Assuming "hot" meant ripe, Shivdutt asked for hot mangoes. She gave them ripe mangoes, and as they blew the dust off before eating, the girl teased,<br>

    “You seem to have hot mangoes indeed; otherwise, why cool them with your breath?”<br><br>

Embarrassed by her wit, Shivdutt grew furious.<br>

    “I will marry her and teach her a lesson for insulting me,” he vowed.<br><br>

Namdev disapproved of this revengeful motive, but Shivdutt was determined.<br><br>

<b>A Marriage of Pride</b><br><br>

Namdev discovered that the girl’s name was <b>Kalavati</b>, the daughter of <b>Pandit Ramanand</b>. Shivdutt devised a plan: disguised as scholars, they impressed Ramanand with their knowledge. Pleased, Ramanand offered them hospitality, and Shivdutt set a condition:<br>

    “In return for our stay, grant me any wish I ask.”<br><br>

Ramanand agreed. Later, Shivdutt demanded Kalavati’s hand in marriage. Although surprised, Ramanand consented, believing Shivdutt was a wise match for his daughter.<br><br>

<b>The Test of True Wisdom</b><br><br>

After their marriage, Shivdutt told Kalavati,<br>

    “You humiliated me in the garden. Now, you should feel sorry.”<br><br>

Kalavati calmly replied,<br>

    “You’re acting like a simple villager, slow to understand deeper meanings.”<br><br>

Angry and humiliated, Shivdutt left her that night, but not before placing his ring on her finger—a silent reminder of their bond.<br><br>

<b>Kalavati’s Clever Plan</b><br><br>

Kalavati soon discovered the ring’s inscription, revealing Shivdutt’s identity. Determined to bring him back, she disguised herself as <b>Anarkali</b>, a renowned dancer, and set up a grand tent near Taxila. Her beauty and intellect quickly drew attention, including that of Shivdutt.<br><br>

Unaware of her true identity, Shivdutt fell in love with Anarkali and married her. When she became pregnant, she returned to <b>Patliputra</b> without revealing the truth.<br><br>

<b>The Son’s Quest for Reunion</b><br><br>

Years passed, and Kalavati’s son, now skilled in various arts, learned of his father’s abandonment. Determined to reunite his family, he went to Taxila. Finding Shivdutt gambling, the boy cleverly defeated him in every game. Impressed, Shivdutt invited him to stay.<br><br>

The boy challenged his father to a storytelling contest, where the loser would become the winner’s servant. Shivdutt accepted, but the boy’s wisdom outmatched his at every turn. Upon his defeat, Shivdutt agreed to follow the boy.<br><br>

<b>A Family Reunited</b><br><br>

The boy brought Shivdutt back to Patliputra, where Kalavati revealed her identity and their shared history. Overwhelmed with remorse and love, Shivdutt embraced his wife and son.<br><br>

    “I will never leave you again,” Shivdutt promised, realizing that true wisdom lay not in pride, but in humility and love.<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b><br> True wisdom is not just in knowledge but in understanding the deeper meanings of life. Arrogance leads to downfall, but love, patience, and humility bring harmony and reunion.

Once there were two <b>rats</b> who were good friends. One of them lived in a <b>city</b> and the other lived in a <b>village</b>. Both of them exchanged news of their <b>well-being</b> through other <b>rats</b> who traveled between the two places.

<br><br>

Once, the <b>city rat</b> wished to meet his <b>village friend</b>. He sent a message through some <b>village rats</b>. The <b>village rat</b> was very excited about his friend\'s visit and made preparations to welcome him. To receive his friend, he went to the border of the village wearing a traditional dress like a <b>dhoti</b>, <b>kurta</b>, and <b>cap</b>, with a <b>garland</b> in his hand. However, his <b>city friend</b> was wearing a <b>suit</b>, <b>boots</b>, and a <b>necktie</b>. They hugged each other and exchanged <b>greetings</b>.

<br><br>

The <b>village rat</b> welcomed him and said, <b>"We have fresh and unpolluted air here. The atmosphere in the city is impure."</b>

<br><br>

They talked a lot and shared their views on different topics. Then, they sat down to eat. The <b>village rat</b> served him <b>fruits</b> and <b>boiled wheat grains</b>.

<br><br>

After eating, they went for a stroll outside the village. The fields looked <b>green</b>, and the natural beauty of the jungle had its own charm. The <b>village rat</b> said, <b>"Does the city have such beautiful scenes?"</b> The <b>city rat</b> said nothing but invited the <b>village rat</b> to visit the <b>city</b> at least once to experience its comfortable lifestyle.

<br><br>

The <b>village rat</b> agreed and said he would visit the city one day. The <b>city rat</b> replied, <b>"Why don’t you come with me now?"</b> The <b>village rat</b> responded, <b>"All right, I will consider your proposal."</b>

<br><br>

When night fell, they returned and slept on the soft <b>grass</b>. The next day, for breakfast, the <b>village rat</b> served his friend fresh <b>fruits</b> and <b>cereals</b>. The <b>city rat</b> was irritated and said, <b>"Let us go to the city right now. Give me a chance to serve you."</b>

<br><br>

The <b>village rat</b> accepted the proposal and got ready for the journey to the <b>city</b>. The <b>city rat</b> lived in a <b>big house</b>. At night, the <b>village rat</b> was surprised to see the <b>dining table</b> full of different kinds of <b>dishes</b>. The <b>village rat</b> had never seen such a variety of <b>food</b> before. The <b>city rat</b> asked his friend to enjoy the <b>meal</b> and then began eating.

<br><br>

The <b>village rat</b> particularly liked the <b>paneer</b> and quickly finished a piece. Suddenly, they heard the sound of a <b>cat</b>. The <b>city rat</b> said, <b>"Quickly hide under the almirah, or the cat will catch us!"</b> Both rushed under the <b>almirah</b> and hid there.

<br><br>

After a while, when the <b>cat</b> left, both came out. The <b>village rat</b> was still trembling. The <b>city rat</b> continued eating and advised his friend, <b>"Do not be afraid. This is part of city life."</b> The <b>village rat</b> gathered his courage and returned to the <b>table</b>. This time, he quickly finished a <b>cake</b> he liked.

<br><br>

Just then, a <b>boy</b> entered the room with a <b>dog</b>. The <b>village rat</b>, scared of the <b>dog</b>, asked, <b>"Who is this fellow?"</b> The <b>city rat</b> replied, <b>"He is Jimmi, the son of the master of this house, and the dog is his pet. Hurry and hide!"</b>

<br><br>

After the <b>boy</b> and the <b>dog</b> left, both <b>rats</b> came out of hiding. The <b>village rat</b> was very frightened and said, <b>"Friend, I think I should go back now. I am grateful for the delicious food, but there are too many dangers here. Thank you again."</b> He then set off for the <b>village</b>.

<br><br>

Upon reaching home, he heaved a sigh of relief and said, <b>"Oh! Life is precious, and above all, wisdom is the greatest wealth."</b>

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
<b>It is better to live a simple, peaceful, and safe life than to enjoy luxuries while living in constant fear.</b>

<item><![CDATA[Once there lived a <b>woodcutter</b> with his <b>wife</b>. He used to cut <b>wood</b> in the forest and sell it in the market. This was the only means of his <b>livelihood</b>.

<br><br>

One day, he went to cut <b>wood</b> in the forest. On the way, he was <b>singing</b> a song and enjoying <b>nature</b> and its beauty. There, he saw a very <b>big tree</b> standing before him. He thought of cutting the whole tree to get more wood. Since the tree was so large, the wood obtained from it would be enough for his <b>whole life</b>.

<br><br>

As the <b>woodcutter</b> picked up his <b>axe</b> to cut the tree, he suddenly heard a voice: <b>"Please do not cut this tree."</b> The woodcutter stopped and looked around but found no one. He thought it was just an <b>illusion</b>.

<br><br>

He picked up his axe again and aimed at the tree, but once more, he heard the same voice: <b>"Please be kind to me. Do not cut this tree."</b> The woodcutter, now perplexed, looked all around but still saw no one. Then, a <b>fairy</b> spoke from within the tree, <b>"I am a fairy and I live in this tree. During the winter, I stay in the trunk, and for the rest of the year, I live on its branches. If you cut this tree, I will be homeless. The winter is approaching fast, and I will die from the cold. Please do not destroy my home. I will fulfill three of your wishes instead."</b>

<br><br>

The <b>woodcutter</b> was very happy. He thought, <b>"Now I can become rich without doing any hard work!"</b> He gladly accepted the fairy’s offer and ran home to share the news with his <b>wife</b>.

<br><br>

His wife, waiting for him as usual, was surprised to see him return so early. She asked, <b>"Why are you back so soon? You look very happy. What’s the matter?"</b>

<br><br>

The woodcutter replied, <b>"I found a great treasure today—well, it’s not here yet, but I will soon have it!"</b> Overjoyed, he started <b>dancing</b>. His wife, confused, said, <b>"What’s going on? Tell me clearly; I can’t hold my patience any longer."</b>

<br><br>

The woodcutter narrated the entire incident. His wife jumped with <b>joy</b>. Then the woodcutter said, <b>"I am hungry. Give me something to eat."</b>

<br><br>

His wife replied, <b>"Since you usually come late, I haven’t prepared anything yet. I’ll cook something quickly."</b>

<br><br>

The woodcutter said, <b>"No, don’t cook anything. I can fulfill any three wishes now! For my first wish, I want sweets and hot pudding."</b>

<br><br>

As soon as he uttered those words, a plate of <b>hot pudding</b> appeared before him. He ate to his satisfaction, and the plate kept refilling again and again. He then asked his wife to enjoy the pudding too.

<br><br>

However, she was angry and said, <b>"You’ve wasted a wish on pudding! I wish that pudding would stick to your nose!"</b> Instantly, the pudding stuck to his <b>nose</b>.

<br><br>

The woodcutter became annoyed and shouted, <b>"Oh, what a foolish thing you’ve done!"</b> He tried to remove the pudding, but it remained stuck. Frustrated, he scolded his wife, <b>"You’ve wasted the second wish! We could have asked for riches!"</b>

<br><br>

His wife replied, <b>"There’s pudding stuck to your nose, and you’re still thinking about money?"</b>

<br><br>

The woodcutter, irritated, exclaimed, <b>"I wish this pudding would vanish from my nose immediately!"</b> The pudding disappeared, and the woodcutter sighed in relief.

<br><br>

In this way, the <b>woodcutter</b> and his <b>wife</b> wasted all three wishes. Their chance at becoming rich slipped away, and they remained as <b>poor</b> as before. Luck had knocked at their door, but they failed to take advantage of it.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
<b>Foolishness and impatience can cause us to lose golden opportunities. Use wisdom to make the most of what life offers.</b>

<item><![CDATA[There were four friends named <b>Mahesh</b>, <b>Ramesh</b>, <b>Rakesh</b>, and <b>Mohan</b>. They all belonged to the same village. One day, they were invited to attend a <b>marriage function</b> in a distant village. They decided to travel together to attend the celebration.

<br><br>

On the day of the marriage, they started their journey early in the morning, hoping to cross the <b>forest</b> before darkness fell.

<br><br>

While crossing the forest cautiously, they couldn’t enjoy its beauty because they were afraid of the <b>wild animals</b>. Their only focus was to move quickly and cross the forest as soon as possible.

<br><br>

By noon, they had covered more than half the distance. Suddenly, <b>Mahesh</b> asked the others to stop and said, <b>"There might be danger ahead, as this area is known for its tigers. Let's check for any signs of danger before proceeding."</b> They all looked around carefully.

<br><br>

At that moment, <b>Mohan</b> noticed the <b>tail of a tiger</b> behind some bushes. Trembling with fear, he cried out, <b>"There’s a tiger behind the bushes! What should we do? How can we save our lives?"</b>

<br><br>

<b>Mahesh</b> calmly replied, <b>"Don’t be afraid of the tiger. Have faith in God. Let’s pray—He will protect us."</b>

<br><br>

But <b>Ramesh</b> had a different idea. He quickly climbed a tree and shouted to his friends, <b>"Don’t waste time talking! Quickly, climb up a tree. God helps those who help themselves. Hurry up and save yourselves!"</b>

<br><br>

Following his advice, <b>Mahesh</b>, <b>Rakesh</b>, and <b>Mohan</b> rushed to nearby trees and climbed up as quickly as they could. From their safe spots, they waited silently for the tiger to leave.

<br><br>

After some time, the tiger wandered off, and the friends descended from the trees. They continued their journey, eventually crossing the forest safely. Finally, they reached the village and joyfully attended the <b>marriage party</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
<b>God helps those who help themselves. Quick thinking and timely action can save us from danger.</b>

<item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, there was a poor man named <b>Raghav</b>. He was so poor that he never thought of marriage or taking on the responsibilities of a family. He never worked permanently in one place but did any job he found wholeheartedly. He never negotiated his wages and was always content with the remuneration he received. This was why there was never a shortage of work for him—people always preferred calling <b>Raghav</b> for their tasks.

<br><br>

Sometimes, odd jobs were also given to <b>Raghav</b>, such as cutting firewood, washing clothes, and bathing animals. This way, he remained busy all the time. In the evening, before returning home, he would take a bath in the river and visit the temple daily.

<br><br>

One day, <b>Raghav</b> noticed that the <b>god’s statue</b> in the temple looked a bit perturbed, staring sadly at him. He thought, <i>"Either the god is tired, or perhaps he cannot tolerate the smoke of the incense sticks, or maybe the garlands are too heavy for him."</i>

<br><br>

With folded hands, he said, <b>"Oh God, it seems you are tired. Come with me to my house. I will serve you delicious food."</b>

<br><br>

The god smiled at <b>Raghav’s</b> simplicity and innocence. Seeing the god smile, <b>Raghav</b> was surprised. Then the god spoke, <b>"Go home, prepare food for me, and then return to take me with you."</b>

<br><br>

Feeling blessed, <b>Raghav</b> quickly rushed home and prepared food for the god and himself. On his way back to the temple, an old man stopped him and said, <b>"My son, I am hungry and haven’t eaten for two days. Can you give me some food?"</b>

<br><br>

<b>Raghav</b> kindly replied, <b>"Why not? Come with me."</b> He took the old man home and served him food. After eating, the old man blessed him and left.

<br><br>

Once again, <b>Raghav</b> rushed toward the temple, but an old woman stopped him and pleaded, <b>"I am very hungry. Will you give me some food?"</b> Feeling pity for her, <b>Raghav</b> said, <b>"Please come with me."</b> He served her food, and she left with gratitude.

<br><br>

As he proceeded to the temple again, a little boy approached him and said, <b>"I am hungry and haven’t eaten since morning."</b> Though in a hurry, <b>Raghav</b> took the boy home and fed him. The boy revealed that he was an orphan and had no place to live. Moved by compassion, <b>Raghav</b> offered the boy shelter in his home.

<br><br>

Finally, <b>Raghav</b> returned to the temple and said to the god with folded hands, <b>"Oh God, I am sorry for coming late."</b> The god replied, <b>"You have already served me."</b>

<br><br>

Surprised, <b>Raghav</b> asked, <b>"When did I serve you, my Lord?"</b>

<br><br>

The god smiled and said, <b>"When you fed the old man, the old woman, and the little boy, you were feeding me. I am very pleased with your kindness."</b>

<br><br>

<b>Raghav</b> humbly said, <b>"But you promised to come to my house."</b> The god replied, <b>"Go home, and I will be there soon."</b>

<br><br>

As soon as <b>Raghav</b> reached his house, a bright light filled the room, and the god appeared. <b>Raghav</b> joyfully welcomed him but humbly said, <b>"I have no food left, but I will bring fruits for you."</b> The god blessed him for his pure heart and disappeared, leaving <b>Raghav</b> with the happiest memory of his life.

<br><br>

Meanwhile, the village landlord heard of the god’s visit to <b>Raghav’s</b> house and grew jealous. He thought, <i>"I have spent so much money building the temple, yet the god has never come to my house."</i>

<br><br>

The landlord went to the temple and requested the god to visit his house. The god agreed and said, <b>"Go home and prepare food for me. I will come."</b> The landlord ordered grand meals to be prepared and rushed back to the temple.

<br><br>

On his way, he encountered an old man begging for food, but the landlord scolded him. Later, an old woman begged for food, but he ignored her. A little boy also asked for food, but the landlord pushed him aside in frustration.

<br><br>

Upon reaching the temple, the landlord said, <b>"Oh god, the food is ready. Please come to my house."</b>

<br><br>

The god replied, <b>"I already came to your house—first as the old man, then the old woman, and then the little boy. But you ignored me each time."</b> With that, the god disappeared.

<br><br>

The landlord realized his mistake, felt deep remorse, and vowed to be kind to everyone from that day forward.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
<b>True service to God lies in helping those in need. Acts of kindness and compassion are the purest forms of worship.</b>

<item><![CDATA[In the small village of <b>Palampur</b>, near <b>Shimla</b>, people lived modest lives, earning just enough to meet their daily needs. Near the village was a <b>railway station</b>, where a small market eventually developed. Among the villagers was a poor laborer named <b>Ramlal</b>, who worked in the market on daily wages. His earnings were meager, yet he managed to provide for his family, which included his four children.
<br><br> Of all his children, <b>Bhola</b> was the most notorious. He had no interest in studies and would come up with countless excuses to avoid going to school. Instead of eating homemade food, he preferred <b>chocolates</b>, <b>toffees</b>, and <b>junk food</b>. Every day, he asked his father for money under false pretenses and spent it recklessly.
<br><br> <b>Ramlal</b> grew increasingly worried about his son\'s bad habits and eventually made a strict decision: <b>he would no longer give Bhola any money</b>.
<br><br> When <b>Bhola</b> heard his father’s decision, he was upset. He realized that if he didn’t earn any money that day, he would not get food in the evening. Desperate for a solution, <b>Bhola</b> went to his mother and explained the situation. Out of sympathy, she gave him <b>fifty rupees</b>.
<br><br> <b>Bhola</b> rushed to his father with the money, but <b>Ramlal</b> immediately knew that his son had not earned the money himself. He asked <b>Bhola</b> to throw the money into a <b>well</b>. Reluctantly, <b>Bhola</b> obeyed.
<br><br> <b>Ramlal</b> then firmly told <b>Bhola</b>,

    "<b>I asked you to earn the money yourself. If you don't earn fifty rupees by the evening, you won't get food.</b>"
    <br><br> Still unwilling to work, <b>Bhola</b> went back to his mother for money, but she refused this time. He then asked his sister, who, feeling pity, gave him <b>fifty rupees</b>. When <b>Bhola</b> presented the money to his father, <b>Ramlal</b> again asked him to throw it into the <b>well</b>. <b>Bhola</b>, though upset, followed his father’s command.
    <br><br> Realizing that no one would give him more money, <b>Bhola</b> left the house feeling hopeless. He sat by the roadside, crying. A kind stranger passing by noticed him and asked why he was upset. After hearing <b>Bhola’s</b> story, the man said,
    "<b>You need to work to earn money. No one gives money for free. Why don’t you go to the railway station and help carry passengers' luggage?</b>"
    <br><br> The man handed his own bag to <b>Bhola</b> and paid him <b>twenty rupees</b> for carrying it. Inspired by the stranger’s advice, <b>Bhola</b> spent the rest of the day helping passengers and managed to earn <b>fifty rupees</b> by evening.
    <br><br> <b>Bhola</b> returned home excitedly and handed the hard-earned money to his father. As expected, <b>Ramlal</b> told him to throw the money into the <b>well</b> again. But this time, <b>Bhola</b> stood firm and said,
    "<b>I worked hard for this money. I won’t throw it away. I carried loads at the railway station, and I now understand the value of my effort.</b>"
    <br><br> Hearing this, <b>Ramlal</b> hugged his son affectionately and said,
    "<b>Now you understand the true value of hard work. This is how I earn our living too. I hope you will now appreciate money and avoid wasting it on useless things.</b>"
    <br><br> <b>Ramlal</b> encouraged <b>Bhola</b> to focus on his studies and become a good citizen. <b>Bhola</b>, filled with confidence, promised,
    "<b>I will study hard, respect money, and work to become a responsible person in life.</b>"
    <br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
<br><br> <b>Hard work</b> and <b>persistence</b> are the keys to success. One should never waste money earned through effort and must always strive to become a responsible and good citizen.  ]]></item>
<item><![CDATA[In the heart of the <b>Champak forest</b>, there lived a notorious monkey named <b>Cheenu</b>. He was infamous for harassing the small and weak animals and birds of the forest.
<br><br> Cheenu often destroyed the birds’ nests and threw away their precious eggs. The <b>rabbits</b> lived in constant fear of being scratched by him, and he would mischievously twist the <b>jackals’</b> tails just for fun. Almost all the animals in the forest were terrified of Cheenu and desperately wished to get rid of him. But the question remained—<b>how could they free themselves from this bully?</b>
<br><br> In the same forest, there lived a clever <b>jackal</b>. Determined to teach Cheenu a lesson, he approached the monkey and said,

    "<b>Your body is very attractive, and the golden hair adds to your beauty. But there’s one flaw.</b>"
    <br><br> Surprised, <b>Cheenu</b> asked,
    "<b>What flaw? Tell me quickly!</b>"
    <br><br> The jackal slyly replied,
    "<b>Your face is red, which doesn’t match your beautiful body. But I know a way to make your face glow like the moon.</b>"
    <br><br> Overjoyed and excited, <b>Cheenu</b> eagerly asked,
    "<b>Tell me the method quickly! How can I make my face glow?</b>"
    <br><br> The jackal said,
    "<b>You need to eat the <i>swargafal</i> (fruit of heaven). It will give your face a divine glow.</b>"
    <br><br> Cheenu, now obsessed with the idea, asked,
    "<b>Where can I find this swargafal?</b>"
    <br><br> The jackal cunningly responded,
    "<b>It lies in the forehead of an elephant. When you see an elephant, hit his forehead with a stone. The swargafal will fall into his trunk, and when the elephant lowers his trunk, quickly grab it.</b>"
    <br><br> Cheenu couldn’t wait to try this trick. Soon, an <b>elephant</b> passed by. Without a second thought, the foolish monkey hit the elephant’s forehead with a heavy stone.
    <br><br> <b>Blood</b> oozed out of the elephant’s wound, and he let out a thunderous roar of pain and anger. The entire forest trembled in fear. But Cheenu, blinded by greed, thought the <b>swargafal</b> had slipped into the elephant’s trunk.
    <br><br> In his desperation, Cheenu threw another stone, angering the elephant even more. The furious elephant, now completely enraged, scanned the forest for his attacker.
    <br><br> When the elephant spotted <b>Cheenu</b> approaching to collect the imaginary <b>swargafal</b>, he charged toward him with unstoppable fury.
    <br><br> The elephant swiftly caught Cheenu with his powerful trunk, threw him to the ground, and trampled him under his mighty feet. <b>Cheenu died instantly</b>.
    <br><br> A wave of <b>joy</b> and <b>relief</b> spread across the forest. The animals were grateful to the elephant for ridding them of the wicked monkey. They also praised the clever <b>jackal</b> for his wit and intelligence.
    <br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
<br><br> <b>Arrogance</b> and <b>cruelty</b> never lead to good outcomes. Evil deeds eventually bring destruction upon the doer, and intelligence will always triumph over mischief.

Once there lived a <b>goat</b> along with her <b>seven kids</b> near a forest. She loved her kids very much.
<br><br> One day, before leaving to collect food, the goat said,

    "<b>Kids! I am going to the forest to bring food. Do not quarrel, and remember, do not open the door for anyone except me. The wolf always eyes you greedily.</b>"
    <br><br> She kissed her kids and bade them goodbye.
    <br><br> The <b>wolf</b> was already waiting for the goat to leave. Being fond of <b>lamb’s flesh</b>, he knocked on the door and said,
    "<b>Hello kids! It’s your mother. Open the door. I have brought good food for you.</b>"
    <br><br> The kids were intelligent and recognized the voice of the wolf. They replied,
    "<b>O wicked wolf! Do not try to fool us. Go away!</b>"
    <br><br> Determined to deceive them, the wolf practiced speaking like the goat and returned,
    "<b>Hello kids! Open the door. It’s your mother here. Be quick!</b>"
    <br><br> However, the clever kids peeped through the magic glass of the door. Seeing his <b>dark feet</b>, they said,
    "<b>No! We won’t open the door. Our mother’s feet are white, not dark like yours!</b>"
    <br><br> Frustrated, the wolf went to a <b>grocer’s shop</b> and asked him to cover his feet with <b>white flour</b>. The frightened grocer sprinkled flour on his feet.
    <br><br> Now with white feet, the wolf returned and knocked on the door,
    "<b>Hello! Dear children, it’s me. Open the door quickly.</b>"
    <br><br> The kids peeped again and saw the white feet. Believing it was their mother, they opened the door.
    <br><br> But when they saw the <b>wolf</b>, they ran in fear. Some hid under the bed, others behind the curtains. Unfortunately, the cunning wolf caught and ate all of them except the youngest, who cleverly hid inside a <b>big clock</b>.
    <br><br> Later, the goat returned and was shocked to see the door wide open and the house in chaos.
    "<b>Oh kids! What happened? Why did you open the door for a stranger? The wolf has won, and I have lost.</b>"
    <br><br> Suddenly, the youngest kid whispered,
    "<b>Mother, I’m here inside the clock. Please take me out!</b>"
    <br><br> The goat quickly rescued the little one, kissing him lovingly. The kid narrated the entire incident. Then they heard the <b>snoring</b> of the wolf nearby.
    <br><br> The goat said,
    "<b>It seems the wolf is still here. Bring the scissors quickly.</b>"
    <br><br> They found the wolf sleeping in the garden. The goat carefully cut open his belly and rescued all her kids, who were miraculously alive. Then she asked them to fill his belly with <b>big stones</b>.
    <br><br> After stuffing his stomach, the goat stitched the belly back up and returned to the hut.
    <br><br> Soon, the wolf awoke feeling <b>thirsty</b>. He staggered toward the well, but due to the heavy stones in his belly, he lost balance and fell in with a loud splash. He drowned in the deep water.
    <br><br> The goat and her kids, watching from the window, rejoiced. They came out of the hut and danced happily, relieved that they no longer needed to fear the <b>wicked wolf</b>.
    <br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
<br><br> <b>Be cautious of strangers</b> and always listen to your elders. Cleverness and courage can help overcome even the greatest dangers.

Once, an Arab cloth merchant named <b>Ajab</b> set sail on a voyage with his friends. They enjoyed their journey, <b>eating</b>, <b>drinking</b>, and <b>dancing</b> all the way.
<br><br> Suddenly, a <b>storm</b> arose in the sea, destroying the ship completely. All of Ajab’s friends <b>drowned</b>, but Ajab managed to swim to shore, though <b>exhausted</b>, <b>tired</b>, and <b>hungry</b>. He searched for food but found nothing and eventually returned to his country.
<br><br> Later, he heard noises from the seaside and noticed a <b>ship</b> approaching. Fearing it might be pirates or man-eaters, he hid behind a tree to observe.
<br><br> The ship stopped on the shore, and some <b>slaves</b> descended with <b>spades</b>. They dug a pit, brought down large baskets from the ship, and descended into the pit using makeshift steps. Ajab was puzzled by their strange behavior.
<br><br> Soon after, an <b>old man</b> and a small <b>eight-year-old boy</b> arrived. The old man left the pit alone, leaving the child inside, and then covered the pit with mud.
<br><br> Ajab, suspecting that they had buried the child alive, quickly uncovered the pit and went inside. There, he found a door, which led to a chamber lit by candles, filled with <b>baskets of food</b>, and a boy playing <b>chess</b>.
<br><br> Startled by the stranger, the boy hid behind the bed. Ajab comforted him,

    "<b>You don’t need to be afraid. I want to help you. Tell me who those people were and why they left you here.</b>"
    <br><br> The boy introduced himself,
    "<b>My name is Haroon. My father, Rashid, is a wealthy jeweler from Baghdad. I am his only son, born with the blessings of Pir Baba. However, the astrologers warned that my eighth year would be dangerous. They predicted I could die because of someone named Ajab. My father hid me here to protect me until I complete my eighth year—only forty days remain.</b>"
    <br><br> Hearing this, Ajab thought,
    "<b>Why would I harm this innocent child? The astrologer must be wrong.</b>"
    <br><br> Without revealing his name, Ajab said,
    "<b>My son, don’t be afraid. I’ll protect you from all dangers. No harm will come to you as long as I’m here.</b>"
    <br><br> Haroon, comforted by Ajab’s kindness, began to call him <b>Uncle</b>. They bonded deeply, playing together, sharing meals, and telling stories. The two spent <b>thirty-nine happy days</b> together.
    <br><br> On the <b>fortieth day</b>, Ajab helped Haroon get ready. After breakfast, they played chess until evening. Haroon asked for something to eat, and Ajab fetched a <b>watermelon</b> from a basket.
    <br><br> As Ajab reached for a knife on the shelf near the bed, a <b>scorpion</b> stung his foot. In pain, he stumbled and accidentally fell on Haroon, causing the knife to cut Haroon’s palm. Ajab quickly bandaged the wound, tears welling in his eyes.
    <br><br> Haroon asked,
    "<b>Uncle, why are you crying? I’m the one in pain.</b>"
    <br><br> Ajab replied,
    "<b>These are tears of happiness. I am Ajab—the very person your father feared. But I had promised myself to protect you, not harm you. Had anything worse happened, who would have told your father how we spent these forty days?</b>"
    <br><br> Haroon hugged him with joy. Just then, they heard footsteps. Haroon’s father appeared with the slaves.
    <br><br> Haroon ran to his father and shared the whole story. His father, realizing Ajab’s true kindness, hugged Ajab tightly and thanked him for saving his son.
    <br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
<br><br> <b>Destiny can be changed through kindness, courage, and compassion. Fear often blinds us, but understanding brings true protection.</b>

<item><![CDATA[Once, a hardworking <b>farmer</b> bought two healthy <b>oxen</b> from a fair. Though he returned home very late, he was overjoyed with his new purchase. These strong <b>oxen</b> meant he no longer needed to rely on others to <b>plow</b> his fields, and he also planned to earn extra money by lending them out for work.
<br><br> The next morning, the <b>farmer</b> set out early with his <b>oxen</b> and worked hard, <b>plowing</b> his fields. At noon, he let the <b>oxen</b> <b>graze</b> freely while he rested under a tree.
<br><br> As the <b>farmer</b> slept, a <b>thief</b> passed by and noticed the unattended <b>oxen</b>. Seizing the opportunity, he quickly roped the animals and tried to lead them away. Just then, the <b>farmer</b> woke up and, seeing the <b>thief</b> stealing his <b>oxen</b>, ran after him and caught him by the neck.
<br><br> <b>Farmer:</b> "Who are you? How dare you steal my <b>oxen</b>!"
<br><br> <b>Thief:</b> "What nonsense! These are my <b>oxen</b>. I bought them yesterday at the fair."
<br><br> The <b>farmer</b>, angered by the <b>thief’s</b> lies, dragged him to a nearby <b>village</b>. There, the two men presented their claims to the <b>villagers</b>.
<br><br> The <b>villagers</b> asked both men to bring <b>witnesses</b> to support their claims. The <b>farmer</b> couldn’t provide any since he had just purchased the <b>oxen</b> the day before, and nobody from the <b>village</b> had seen them yet. The <b>thief</b>, too, had no <b>witnesses</b>. The dispute remained <b>unresolved</b>.
<br><br> <b>Thief:</b> "See! This man has no proof. He’s trying to deceive all of you!"
<br><br> To settle the matter, the <b>villagers</b> took both men to the <b>village physician</b>, known for his wisdom and intelligence. After listening to both sides, the <b>physician</b> quickly understood who the real owner was, but he wanted to resolve the case fairly and openly.
<br><br> He asked both men,
<br><br> <b>Physician:</b> "What did you feed these <b>oxen</b> this morning?"
<br><br> <b>Thief:</b> "Rice and vegetables," replied the <b>thief</b> confidently.
<br><br> <b>Farmer:</b> "I am poor. I could only serve them <b>grass</b>," said the <b>farmer</b> honestly.
<br><br> The <b>physician</b> then administered a <b>purgative</b> to the <b>oxen</b> to induce vomiting. The <b>oxen</b> vomited only <b>grass</b> and passed the same through their rectum, clearly proving the <b>farmer’s</b> claim.
<br><br> <b>Physician:</b> "The truth is clear now. These <b>oxen</b> belong to the <b>farmer</b>."
<br><br> He turned to the <b>thief</b> and said,
<br><br> "Do not steal again. It leads only to ruin."
<br><br> Ashamed, the <b>thief</b> promised never to steal again. The <b>farmer</b>, overjoyed to have his <b>oxen</b> back, thanked the wise <b>physician</b> for his fair judgment.
<br><br> <b>Moral of the Story:</b>
<b>Truth always prevails, and dishonesty never brings lasting gain.</b> ]]></item>

<br><br> One day, a <b>hunter</b> came to the forest. Spotting the beautiful pair of <b>parrots</b>, he thought, "These parrots are very special. I will present them to the <b>king</b>." He spread his <b>net</b> to trap them, and soon both the <b>parrots</b> were caught.
<br><br> The <b>hunter</b> placed them in a <b>cage</b> and took them to the palace.
<br><br> <b>Hunter:</b> "O <b>king</b>, look at this beautiful pair of <b>parrots</b> I caught in the deep forest. I brought them for you, as they will add to the beauty of your palace."
<br><br> The <b>king</b> was very pleased and rewarded the <b>hunter</b> with <b>one thousand coins</b>. The <b>parrots</b> were placed in a golden <b>cage</b>, and the <b>king</b> ordered his attendants to take great care of them.
<br><br> The <b>parrots</b> received royal treatment. They were served <b>fruits</b> and delicious food and became the center of attraction in the palace. Even the young <b>prince</b> often came to play with them.
<br><br> <b>Older Parrot:</b> "We are highly respected here and should be quite satisfied."
<br><br> <b>Younger Brother:</b> "You’re right. We’re lucky to receive such royal treatment."
<br><br> One day, another <b>hunter</b> brought a black <b>monkey</b> named <b>Kala Bahu</b> to the palace. The <b>king</b> ordered the attendants to keep the <b>monkey</b> in the courtyard. The <b>prince</b> and the <b>king</b> were delighted by the <b>monkey’s</b> amusing antics, and soon, <b>Kala Bahu</b> became the new center of attention.
<br><br> The <b>parrots</b> were now neglected, and at times they didn’t even receive food.
<br><br> <b>Older Parrot:</b> "Nothing is permanent in this world. Have patience, and these bad days will pass."
<br><br> One day, the <b>monkey</b> performed such wild stunts that the <b>prince</b> got frightened and cried, "Help! Help!" Hearing his cries, everyone rushed over to protect him. When the <b>king</b> learned what had happened, he immediately ordered the <b>monkey</b> to be returned to the forest.
<br><br> With the <b>monkey</b> gone, the <b>parrots</b> once again received attention and were served delicious food and fruits.
<br><br> <b>Older Parrot:</b> "See, my brother? Time never remains the same. We should never lose patience during difficult days."
<br><br> The younger <b>parrot</b> realized the truth of his brother’s words—that nothing is permanent in life, and patience is the key to overcoming hardship.

<br><br> His <b>mother</b> noticed his tears and asked, "What is the matter? Why are you crying?"
<br><br> The boy replied, "A thorn from the rose pierced my finger while I was plucking it, and now it hurts a lot."
<br><br> His <b>mother</b> gently explained, "It was your mistake. You should not have tried to pluck the flower. Flowers are meant to be admired, not plucked. Besides, we should never harm the natural beauty around us. Instead, we must help preserve nature and respect all living beings."

<br><br> The <b>mother</b> then asked, "Tell me, what lesson have you learned today?"

<item><![CDATA[There was a man who went out in the <b>dark night</b> to borrow <b>live coals</b> to kindle a fire. He went from hut to hut and knocked. <br><br>

"<b>Dear friends, help me!</b>" said he. "<b>My wife has just given birth to a child, and I must make a fire to warm her and the little one.</b>" <br><br>

But it was late in the night, and all the people were asleep. No one replied. <br><br>

The man walked and walked. At last, he saw the gleam of a <b>fire</b> a long way off. Then he went in that direction and saw that the fire was burning in the open. A lot of sheep were sleeping around the fire, and an old shepherd sat and watched over the flock. <br><br>

When the man who wanted to borrow fire came up to the sheep, he saw that <b>three big dogs</b> lay asleep at the shepherd’s feet. All three awoke when the man approached and opened their great jaws as though they wanted to bark, but <b>not a sound was heard</b>. The man noticed that the hair on their backs stood up and that their sharp, white teeth glistened in the firelight. They dashed toward him. <br><br>

He felt that one of them bit at his leg, one at his hand, and one clung to his throat. But <b>their jaws and teeth wouldn’t obey them</b>, and the man didn’t suffer the least harm. <br><br>

Now the man wished to go farther to get what he needed. But the <b>sheep lay back to back</b> and so close to one another that he couldn’t pass them. Then the man stepped upon their backs and walked over them and up to the fire. <b>Not one of the animals awoke or moved.</b> <br><br>

When the man had almost reached the fire, the <b>shepherd looked up</b>. He was a surly old man, <b>unfriendly and harsh</b> toward human beings. And when he saw the strange man coming, he seized the <b>long, spiked staff</b>, which he always held in his hand when he tended his flock, and threw it at him. The staff came right toward the man, but, <b>before it reached him, it turned off to one side</b> and whizzed past him, far out in the meadow. <br><br>

Now the man came up to the shepherd and said: "<b>Goodman, help me, and lend me a little fire! My wife has just given birth to a child, and I must make a fire to warm her and the little one.</b>" <br><br>

The shepherd <b>would rather have said no</b>, but when he pondered that the <b>dogs couldn’t hurt the man</b>, the <b>sheep had not run from him</b>, and the <b>staff had not wished to strike him</b>, he was a little afraid and dared not deny the man that which he asked. <br><br>

"<b>Take as much as you need!</b>" he said to the man. <br><br>

But then the fire was nearly burnt out. There were no logs or branches left, only a big heap of <b>live coals</b>, and the stranger had neither <b>spade nor shovel</b> wherein he could carry the red-hot coals. <br><br>

When the shepherd saw this, he said again: "<b>Take as much as you need!</b>" And he was glad that the man wouldn’t be able to take away any coals. <br><br>

But the man stopped and picked coals from the ashes with his <b>bare hands</b> and laid them in his mantle. And he didn’t burn his hands when he touched them, nor did the coals scorch his mantle; but he <b>carried them away</b> as if they had been nuts or apples. <br><br>

And when the shepherd, who was such a <b>cruel and hardhearted man</b>, saw all this, he began to wonder to himself. "<b>What kind of a night is this</b>, when the dogs do not bite, the sheep are not scared, the staff does not kill, or the fire scorch?" <br><br>

He called the stranger back and said to him: "<b>What kind of a night is this? And how does it happen that all things show you compassion?</b>" <br><br>

Then said the man: "<b>I cannot tell you if you yourself do not see it.</b>" And he wished to go his way, that he might soon make a fire and warm his wife and child. <br><br>

But the shepherd did not wish to lose sight of the man before he had found out what all this might mean. He got up and followed the man until they came to the place where he lived. <br><br>

Then the shepherd saw the man <b>didn’t even have a hut</b> to dwell in, but that his wife and babe were lying in a <b>mountain grotto</b>, where there was nothing except the <b>cold and naked stone walls</b>. <br><br>

But the shepherd thought that perhaps the <b>poor innocent child</b> might <b>freeze to death</b> there in the grotto; and, although he was a <b>hard man</b>, he was touched, and thought he would like to help. He loosened the knapsack from his shoulder, took from it a <b>soft white sheepskin</b>, gave it to the strange man, and said that he should let the child sleep on it. <br><br>

But just as soon as he showed that he, too, could be <b>merciful</b>, his <b>eyes were opened</b>, and he saw what he had not been able to see before, and heard what he could not have heard before. <br><br>

He saw that all around him stood a <b>ring of little silver-winged angels</b>, and each held a stringed instrument, and all sang in loud tones that "<b>tonight the Savior was born</b> who should redeem the world from its sins." <br><br>

Then he understood how all things were <b>so happy this night</b> that they didn’t want to do anything wrong. <br><br>

And it was not only around the shepherd that there were <b>angels</b>, but he saw them everywhere. They <b>sat inside the grotto</b>, they <b>sat outside on the mountain</b>, and they <b>flew under the heavens</b>. They came marching in <b>great companies</b>, and, as they passed, they paused and cast a <b>loving glance at the child</b>. <br><br>

There was <b>jubilation and gladness</b>, songs, and play! And all this he saw in the <b>dark night</b>, whereas before, he could not have made out anything. He was so <b>happy</b> because his <b>eyes had been opened</b> that he fell upon his knees and <b>thanked God</b>. <br><br>

What that shepherd saw, we might also see, for the <b>angels fly down from heaven every Christmas Eve</b>, if we could only see them. <br><br>

You must remember this, for it is as <b>true</b> as that <b>I see you, and you see me</b>. It is not revealed by the <b>light of lamps or candles</b>, and it does not depend upon <b>sun and moon</b>; but that which is needed is that we have <b>eyes that can see God’s glory</b>. <br><br>

<b>Long, long time ago</b>, there lived in <b>Patara</b> a man called <b>Nicholas</b>. Patara was a town in the East. <b>Nicholas was very fond of children</b> and was kind and generous to them. The children loved him too, and they came to think of him as their <b>dear friend</b> and their <b>beloved saint</b>. So it was that after a time, the wonderful things he did were woven into a beautiful legend. <br><br>

You know that <b>Santa</b> means <b>Saint</b> and <b>Claus</b> stands for <b>Nicholas</b>, and that is how he came to be known as <b>Santa Claus</b>. <br><br>

Now in <b>Santa Claus’s own town</b>, Patara, there lived a <b>gentle lord</b> who had <b>three daughters</b>. But he was very poor. In fact, <b>so poor</b> was he that one day he was on the point of sending his daughters out to <b>beg for food</b> from his neighbors. <br><br>

But it happened that just a few days earlier, <b>Saint Nicholas had come into a fortune</b>, and as he loved giving to the needy, no sooner did he hear of the trouble the poor lord was in than he made up his mind to help him <b>secretly</b>. <br><br>

So he went to the nobleman’s house at night, and as the moon shone out from behind a cloud, he saw an <b>open window</b> through which he threw a <b>bag of gold</b> inside. <br><br>

When the father found the bag the next morning and opened it, he was <b>ecstatic</b>. It seemed like a <b>godsend</b> to him. He wondered, <b>who sent it?</b> With this timely gift, the father was able to provide for his <b>eldest daughter</b> so that she could be married. <br><br>

On another night, <b>Santa Claus</b> set off with another <b>bag of gold</b> and threw it in at the window, so the <b>second daughter</b> was provided for. <br><br>

When the father found the bag the next morning and opened it, he <b>could not believe his eyes</b>. <b>One more time</b> was he helped. <b>Who was doing this?</b> With this gift, the father was able to marry off his <b>second daughter</b> too. <br><br>

But by this time, the father had grown eager to discover <b>who the mysterious visitor could be</b>, and the next night he kept on the lookout. Then for the <b>third time</b>, <b>Santa Claus</b> came with a <b>bag of gold</b> upon his back and <b>threw it in at the window</b>. The old lord at once recognized his <b>fellow townsman</b>, and falling on his knees, cried out: <br><br>

<b>“Oh! Nicholas, servant of God, why seek to hide?”</b> <br><br>

Is it not wonderful to think that this was <b>so long ago</b>, sixteen hundred years, yet we still look for the <b>secret coming of Santa Claus</b> with his <b>Christmas gifts</b>? <br><br>

At first, he was said to come on <b>his own birthday</b>, which is early in December, but after a while, as was very natural with <b>Christmas so near</b>, the night of his coming was moved on in the calendar, and now we <b>hang up our stockings</b> to receive his gifts on <b>Christmas Eve</b>. <br><br>

In some countries, children still <b>put their shoes by the fireside</b> on his birthday. In others, they say it is the <b>Christ-Kindlein</b> or <b>Christ Child</b> who brings the gifts at Christmastime. But it is always a <b>surprise visit</b>, and though it has happened <b>so many hundreds of times</b>, the <b>hanging up of the Christmas stocking</b> is still as great a delight as ever. <br><br>

<item><![CDATA[Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a poor boy named <b>Ravi</b>. He had no parents and survived by doing small jobs for the villagers.<br><br>

One day, while walking through the forest, he found a <b>magical lamp</b>. When he rubbed it, a <b>genie</b> appeared and said, "Master, I will grant you three wishes!"<br><br>

Excited, Ravi made his first wish: "I wish for a big house with plenty of food!" Instantly, a grand house filled with delicious food appeared.<br><br>

For his second wish, he said, "I wish to be rich and have lots of gold!" The genie granted his wish, and he became the richest person in the village.<br><br>

As Ravi thought about his third wish, he saw a poor old man struggling to carry wood. Remembering his own hardships, he said, "I wish for happiness and prosperity for everyone in my village!"<br><br>

The genie smiled and fulfilled his wish. The entire village prospered, and everyone lived happily. Ravi realized that true happiness comes from sharing and helping others.<br><br>

<b>Moral of the story:</b> True happiness lies in kindness and generosity.

<item><![CDATA[
Sir, I don’t think I can do this. My family has a trip planned for Christmas. <br><br>

<b>Lily</b> could hear her mom, <b>Susan</b>, urging the caller on the phone. "Are you sure you can’t wait just a couple more days? No? Fine, I will come and pick him up." <br><br>

Lily crept into the kitchen and found her mother with her head in her hands. <br><br>

"What’s wrong, Mom?" Lily asked. <br><br>

"Sweetie, I need to go and save a stray dog from a farm. The farmer who found him is ready to take him to the pound. He says he can’t wait until after Christmas." <br><br>

"Oh no! We can’t let that happen. When are we going?" Lily loved helping her mom rescue animals. <br><br>

"Well, it will mean canceling our trip to Grandma’s house—are you sure about this?" <br><br>

"You bet!" And with that, Lily rushed up to her mom and squeezed her tight. "I am proud that my mom has an animal rescue, and I love being your partner." <br><br>

Two years ago, Lily’s mom founded an animal rescue for stray and unwanted <b>Labrador Retrievers</b>. In truth, they saved all kinds of animals but had an extra soft spot for <b>Labs</b>. <br><br>

Lily and her mom loaded up the car with a crate, a blanket, and some <b>Milk Bones</b>. The farmer had warned Susan that this dog was very thin and hungry. <br><br>

The trip took about an hour, and by the time Lily and her mom arrived at the farm, it was pitch-black outside and freezing. This was not the kind of night any animal should be left outside alone. <br><br>

"Lily, let me go up to the door. I don’t see any lights on, so I want to make sure it’s safe." <br><br>

"Not a chance," Lily urged back. "I am going too." <br><br>

So the pair walked to the front door and knocked and knocked, but there was no answer. <br><br>

Then Lily noticed a piece of paper shoved between the crevices of the door. She carefully pulled it out and handed it to her mom. <br><br>

The note simply said, "<b>He’s around back.</b>" <br><br>

"Oh, good grief," Susan responded. "What have we gotten ourselves into?" <br><br>

"A rescue!" Lily responded with a thumbs-up and a smile. <br><br>

The two rescuers carefully made their way toward the backyard. All of a sudden, out of the darkness, they heard a loud rustling sound coming straight at them. Susan put her body in front of Lily, just in case this dog turned out to be aggressive. <br><br>

What they saw immediately put them at ease. Running toward Susan and Lily was a beautiful <b>black Labrador Retriever</b> who seemed to be smiling. He stopped right at their feet and lay down. He was as friendly as they come, with big floppy ears and a dangling tongue. <br><br>

"Oh, Mom, he is so skinny," Lily gasped as she began to pet him from head to toe. <br><br>

"Yes, he is. He is just skin and bones, poor guy." <br><br>

"That’s it!" Lily shouted. "That can be his name! Can we call him <b>Bones</b>, please?" <br><br>

Susan chuckled. "Of course, we can, dear. Of course, we can." <br><br>

They loaded <b>Bones</b> up and headed home. He was quite the gentleman in the car and ate every one of his <b>Milk Bones</b>—except one. <br><br>

As they pulled into the driveway, <b>Bones</b> really started wagging his tail—<b>thump, thump, thump</b>. He knew he was safe. <br><br>

Later that night, Lily and her mom made <b>Bones</b> a bed on the couch. He hopped right up and fell fast asleep. Lily laid his last <b>Milk Bone</b> by his side. <br><br>

"Mom, this is what Christmas is all about—helping and giving to others. And we helped <b>Bones</b>." <br><br>

"Yes, we did, Lily. This has turned out to be a wonderful Christmas Eve." <br><br>

The next morning was Christmas. Lily jumped from her bed and rushed downstairs, eagerly hoping to find their new addition all snug as a bug in his new sleeping arrangements. <br><br>

She looked on the couch, but he wasn’t there. She decided to go into the kitchen—after all, all dogs love the kitchen—but he wasn’t there either. Lily was beginning to get worried. <br><br>

Finally, Lily went into the office, where their Christmas tree stood—adorned with tinsel, lights, and handmade decorations. And to her delight, she found what she’d been looking for—<b>Bones</b>. He was all curled up in a ball right underneath the tree, with a single <b>Milk Bone</b> resting by his side. <br><br>

Lily knew this Christmas would be extra special. She had learned that <b>giving is far better than receiving</b>. And she learned this from a very special stray dog named <b>Bones</b>. <br><br>

<b>Moral of the story:</b>
True joy comes from selflessness and kindness. Helping those in need, even at personal sacrifice, brings the greatest happiness of all. ❤️ <br><br>

<b>One dollar and eighty-seven cents.</b> That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bargaining with the grocer, the vegetable man, and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of miserliness that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. <b>One dollar and eighty-seven cents.</b> And the next day would be Christmas.<br><br>

There was nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and cry. So Della did. This leads to the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.<br><br>

While the mistress of the home gradually subsides from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the poverty police.<br><br>

In the vestibule below was a mailbox into which no letter would go and an electric button that no mortal finger could coax a ring from. Also attached to it was a card bearing the name <b>Mr. James Dillingham Young.</b><br><br>

The <b>Dillingham</b> had been added during a former period of prosperity when its owner was earning $30 per week. Now, when the income had shrunk to $20, they were thinking seriously of shortening it to a modest and unassuming <b>D.</b> But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above, he was called <b>Jim</b> and was warmly embraced by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as <b>Della.</b> Which was all very good.<br><br>

Della finished her cry, powdered her cheeks, and stood by the window, looking dully at a gray cat walking along a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow was Christmas Day, and she had only <b>$1.87</b> to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny for months, but expenses had been greater than she had calculated. Only <b>$1.87</b> to buy a gift for her <b>Jim.</b> Many happy hours had been spent planning for something fine, rare, and sterling—something just a little bit worthy of being owned by <b>Jim.</b><br><br>

There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person, by observing their reflection in rapid sequence, could obtain a fairly accurate conception of their appearance. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.<br><br>

Suddenly, she turned from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes shone brilliantly, but her face lost its color within seconds. Quickly, she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.<br><br>

Now, there were two possessions in which the <b>James Dillingham Youngs</b> took immense pride. One was <b>Jim’s gold watch</b> that had belonged to his father and grandfather. The other was <b>Della’s hair.</b> Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window to depreciate Her Majesty’s jewels. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled in the basement, <b>Jim</b> would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard in envy.<br><br>

So now Della’s beautiful hair rippled and shone like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and was almost a garment in itself. Then, she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.<br><br>

On went her old brown jacket and her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and a brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the street.<br><br>

She stopped at a shop with a sign that read: <b>Mme. Sofronie – Hair Goods of All Kinds.</b> One flight up, Della ran and collected herself, panting.<br><br>

<b>"Will you buy my hair?"</b> asked Della.<br><br>

<b>"I buy hair,"</b> said Madame. <b>"Take your hat off and let me see it."</b><br><br>

Down rippled the brown cascade.<br><br>

<b>"Twenty dollars,"</b> said Madame, lifting the mass with a practiced hand.<br><br>

<b>"Give it to me quick!"</b> said Della.<br><br>

Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. She ransacked the stores for Jim’s present.<br><br>

She found it at last—a platinum fob chain, simple and elegant in design. It was perfect for <b>The Watch.</b> It was even worthy of <b>Jim.</b> It cost her <b>$21,</b> and she hurried home with <b>87 cents</b> remaining.<br><br>

When Jim came home, he was stunned at Della’s short hair, but he quickly reassured her that nothing could make him love her any less. Then, he gave her his present—a beautiful set of jeweled combs she had admired in a Broadway shop window. <b>Della’s heart leaped with joy… but her hair was gone.</b><br><br>

She then eagerly handed Jim her gift—the fob chain. But Jim only smiled and told her, <b>"I sold the watch to buy your combs."</b> They had both given up their most prized possessions for each other.<br><br>

The Magi, as you know, were wise men who brought gifts to the Christ child. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. And here, I have told you the story of two foolish children in a flat who unwisely sacrificed for each other their greatest treasures. But let it be said that of all who give gifts, <b>these two were the wisest.</b> Everywhere, they are the Magi.<br><br>

<b><u>Moral of the Story:</u></b><br><br>

True love and selflessness are the greatest gifts of all. It is not the material wealth but the depth of love and sacrifice that makes a gift truly valuable. The greatest treasures in life are not possessions but the people we cherish.<br><br>

<b>Most terribly cold</b> it was; it snowed, and it was nearly dark. Evening had come—the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness, a poor little girl walked along the street, <b>bareheaded</b> and with <b>bare feet</b>. When she left home, she had worn slippers, but they were too large for her—once belonging to her mother. She lost them while running across the street to avoid two fast-moving carriages. <br><br>

One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other was taken by an urchin who ran off, thinking it would serve well as a cradle when he had children someday. So the little maiden walked on with her tiny, bare feet, which were now red and blue from the cold. She carried a bundle of matches in an old apron and held some in her hand. No one had bought anything from her all day; no one had given her a single coin.<br><br>

She crept along, trembling from cold and hunger—a true picture of sorrow. Snowflakes covered her long, fair hair, which fell in beautiful curls around her neck, but she did not think of that now. From all the windows, candles gleamed, and the delicious smell of roasted goose filled the air—it was New Year’s Eve, after all.<br><br>

In a corner formed by two houses, where one jutted out further than the other, she sat down and huddled together for warmth. She pulled her little feet close to her body, but she grew colder. She dared not go home, for she had not sold any matches and could bring no money. Her father would surely be angry. And besides, it was cold at home too, where the wind whistled through the roof, even though they had tried to block the largest cracks with straw and rags.<br><br>

Her little hands were almost numb. Oh! A match might provide some warmth, if only she dared to take one from the bundle, strike it against the wall, and warm her fingers. She pulled one out. <b>Scratch!</b> It burned brightly. It was a warm, golden flame, like a tiny candle, as she cupped her hands around it. It seemed to her as though she were sitting in front of a great iron stove with brass feet and decorations. The fire burned so warmly, giving such comfort. She stretched out her feet to warm them, but then—the flame went out. The stove vanished. All that remained was the burnt match in her hand.<br><br>

She struck another match against the wall. It flared up, and suddenly the wall became transparent. She could see inside a grand room where a table was set with a snow-white cloth, elegant porcelain dishes, and a roasted goose stuffed with apples and plums. But just as the goose moved—yes, it walked towards her with a knife and fork in its breast—the match went out, and once again, only the cold, damp wall remained.<br><br>

She struck another match. Now she saw a <b>magnificent Christmas tree</b>, even larger and more beautifully decorated than the one she had seen through the window of a rich merchant’s house. Thousands of lights gleamed on its green branches, and brightly colored pictures gazed down at her. She reached out her hands toward them—and the match went out. The lights rose higher and higher until they became stars in the night sky. Then, one of them fell, leaving a trail of fire.<br><br>

“Someone has just died,” the little girl whispered. Her grandmother—the only person who had ever loved her and who had passed away—had once told her that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.<br><br>

She struck another match, and once again, a warm glow appeared. This time, her beloved grandmother stood before her, radiant and gentle, her eyes full of love.<br><br>

“Grandmother!” the little girl cried. “Oh, take me with you! When the match burns out, you will disappear like the warm stove, the delicious goose, and the beautiful Christmas tree!” Desperate to keep her grandmother near, she quickly struck the whole bundle of matches against the wall. They flared up so brightly that it seemed brighter than the midday sun. Never had her grandmother looked so beautiful and so tall. She took the little girl in her arms, and together, they rose in light and joy—so high, so very high, where there was no more cold, no hunger, no pain. They were with God.<br><br>

But in the corner of the street, at the cold dawn of the new year, sat the poor little girl. Her cheeks were rosy, and she had a sweet smile on her lips, but she was <b>frozen to death</b>. She sat there, still holding the bundle of burnt matches. “She tried to warm herself,” people said. But no one knew what beauty she had seen, nor the splendor in which she and her grandmother had entered the new year.<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b> The story teaches us the importance of kindness, compassion, and the harsh realities faced by those in poverty. While many celebrate, others suffer in silence. It reminds us to be grateful for what we have and to extend love and generosity to those in need.

Once there was an elf named <b>Frez</b> who would get so nervous during Christmas time that he would eat two lunches at the elf cafeteria. He tried to be just too perfect in toymaking and never thought his toys were good enough for the children. <br><br>

The dolls\' eyes never sparkled enough, thought <b>Frez</b>, and the wagons were not as shiny as last year. Nothing seemed to be going right, and the time for delivering the presents was getting closer. <br><br>

It was beyond anybody’s understanding why <b>Frez</b> was getting so particular and even asking for an elf suit larger than his size. Then, one day, <b>Santa</b> found out what the problem was and decided to solve it. It seemed that <b>Frez</b> was not a young elf, but elves never looked their age due to their ever-cheerful and happy nature. <br><br>

<b>Frez</b> needed to feel special, so <b>Santa</b> assigned him his own project called <b>Special Toys</b>. These were the toys that were broken and needed to be repaired with love. <b>Frez</b> was so glad to be in charge of such a project that he had only one lunch that day because he had to hurry back to his tasks. <br><br>

There is a lesson to be learned from what <b>Santa</b> did for the elf. Sometimes we have off days when we just don’t feel positive. Someone’s smile or an invitation to join some friends can make our whole day worthwhile. <br><br>

<b>Frez</b> is now content with assembling the broken toys and transforming them into something new. He has stopped being the voracious eater he once was because he is happy. He even wears his old suit now, and his new suit has been taken in to fit his smaller waist. <br><br>

It’s wise for us to try and do something worthwhile every day so that a <b>Frez Attack</b> will never get us. We all have special talents and potential, and we can definitely help someone out if they are feeling a bit low. It takes only a few seconds to notice when someone is not feeling happy. Take some time out of your usual day and listen. Most importantly, we are here to help each other, and all of us have a hidden talent to do just that. Start making use of that talent today. <br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b> Finding purpose in helping others brings true happiness and fulfillment.

So now Della’s beautiful hair rippled and shone like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and was almost a garment in itself. Then, she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.<br><br>

On went her old brown jacket and her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and a brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the street.<br><br>

She stopped at a shop with a sign that read: <b>Mme. Sofronie – Hair Goods of All Kinds.</b> One flight up, Della ran and collected herself, panting.<br><br>

<b>"Will you buy my hair?"</b> asked Della.<br><br>

<b>"I buy hair,"</b> said Madame. <b>"Take your hat off and let me see it."</b><br><br>

Down rippled the brown cascade.<br><br>

<b>"Twenty dollars,"</b> said Madame, lifting the mass with a practiced hand.<br><br>

<b>"Give it to me quick!"</b> said Della.<br><br>

Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. She ransacked the stores for Jim’s present.<br><br>

She found it at last—a platinum fob chain, simple and elegant in design. It was perfect for <b>The Watch.</b> It was even worthy of <b>Jim.</b> It cost her <b>$21,</b> and she hurried home with <b>87 cents</b> remaining.<br><br>

When Jim came home, he was stunned at Della’s short hair, but he quickly reassured her that nothing could make him love her any less. Then, he gave her his present—a beautiful set of jeweled combs she had admired in a Broadway shop window. <b>Della’s heart leaped with joy… but her hair was gone.</b><br><br>

She then eagerly handed Jim her gift—the fob chain. But Jim only smiled and told her, <b>"I sold the watch to buy your combs."</b> They had both given up their most prized possessions for each other.<br><br>

The Magi, as you know, were wise men who brought gifts to the Christ child. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. And here, I have told you the story of two foolish children in a flat who unwisely sacrificed for each other their greatest treasures. But let it be said that of all who give gifts, <b>these two were the wisest.</b> Everywhere, they are the Magi.<br><br>

<b><u>Moral of the Story:</u></b><br><br>

True love and selflessness are the greatest gifts of all. It is not the material wealth but the depth of love and sacrifice that makes a gift truly valuable. The greatest treasures in life are not possessions but the people we cherish.<br><br>

<item><![CDATA[Esther raced into the house and dropped her books on the kitchen table. Then she saw the big **J.C. Penney’s** catalog with the plain brown wrapper. <br><br>

"Oh!" she said excitedly, "**Mama’s Wish Book!** This year you are going to get the gloves you want, Mama! No more wearing your chore gloves to church!" She snorted, knowing Mama was outside helping Daddy with the milking. Esther had babysat for a neighbor and saved her allowance all year to buy Mama these gloves.<br><br>

That night, Esther waited impatiently for sleep, listening until she no longer heard her parents talking. The cuckoo clock chimed **11:00**. She padded quietly down the wooden steps and into the living room. She quickly scooped up the catalog lying next to Mama’s favorite chair and hurried back up the stairs, trying to be silent.<br><br>

She crawled into bed and yanked the covers over her head. Pulling a flashlight from under her pillow, she prayed that the gloves were still in stock. **The very same ones Mama had longed for!** Tears stung her eyes as she remembered Mama saying to Daddy, "Maybe someday, I’ll get them."<br><br>

Esther flipped to the order sheet and read: **Please allow 6-8 weeks for delivery.** She flashed the light on the calendar. **Christmas Eve was exactly 8 weeks away.** The order had to go in the mail the next morning!<br><br>

Since Mama would notice a missing order sheet, Esther tore a page from her school notebook. She neatly copied the information about the gloves, calculated the tax and postage, and tucked the paper into an envelope.<br><br>

The next day, Esther watched from her upstairs window as a cloud of dust approached the lane. She ran out the back door as fast as she could, hoping Mama wouldn’t see her. When Mr. Nichols saw Esther, he pulled his jeep to the side.<br><br>

"Esther, are you all right?" he asked, concerned.<br><br>

"Yes, I’m fine," she said, out of breath. "But I need to buy a stamp without Mama seeing me." She handed him the exact change.<br><br>

"Hmm... **J.C. Penney’s,**" Mr. Nichols murmured, reading the address.<br><br>

"Yes, but please don’t tell her. It’s a Christmas gift for Mama. It’s our secret, okay?"<br><br>

With a twinkle in his eye, Mr. Nichols chuckled. **His belly shook, and his cheeks turned red.** Esther had never realized how white his beard was until now. In fact, he reminded her of Santa Claus!<br><br>

As Esther walked back up the lane, she knew she had to tell Daddy her secret.<br><br>

"You’ve got to get the mail every day," Esther whispered to Daddy as she helped with the milking chores.<br><br>

"And why might that be?" Daddy asked with a grin.<br><br>

"I have a package coming for Mama, and she can’t see it."<br><br>

Every day, when Esther came home from school, she peeked at Daddy. When Mama wasn’t looking, he shook his head. The days turned into weeks, and **Christmas approached quickly.** They cut down a tiny tree in the back pasture and hung a bright yellow star at the top, a gift from Grandma. Mama popped popcorn, stringing it into a chain to loop around the branches. Carefully, she unwrapped her collection of homemade ornaments and placed them on the tree.<br><br>

Finally, **Christmas Eve arrived.** Daddy came back from the mailbox **empty-handed.**<br><br>

Esther felt sick to her stomach as she went to bed, knowing she had nothing to give Mama. She knew Mama would be up late sewing their gifts to place under the tree.<br><br>

The next morning, Esther opened her gift. **A beautiful new dress, sewn by Mama’s loving hands.**<br><br>

"Thank you for making this dress, Mama! I love it!" She ran to hug her mother. "I’m just so sorry I don’t have anything for you."<br><br>

"That’s okay, Esther. I have you and your Daddy. I don’t need anything else!"<br><br>

As Mama pulled the apple pies from the oven, Esther set the table for Christmas dinner. Then, they heard a vehicle pulling up the driveway. **They all rushed to the window.**<br><br>

**Mr. Nichols was making his way to the kitchen door—holding a package in his hand!**<br><br>

"That has to be Mama’s glo—" Esther stopped mid-sentence. "**Glorious surprise!**" she finished quickly.<br><br>

Mr. Nichols handed Mama the package. "I believe this is yours," he said with a twinkle in his eye.<br><br>

Mama looked from Daddy to Esther, then slowly opened the package. **Her eyes lit up when she saw the gloves.**<br><br>

"Oh, my goodness!" she exclaimed. "Who’s responsible for these?"<br><br>

"I’d say Santa is," Esther grinned. "If he hadn’t delivered the package on Christmas Day, you wouldn’t have gotten them!"<br><br>

**"Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!"** Mr. Nichols bellowed, his belly shaking with laughter.<br><br>

It was **a Christmas that no one would ever forget.**<br><br>

---<br>
**Moral of the Story:**<br>
The greatest gifts come from the heart. True joy is found in **selflessness, love, and giving**—not just in receiving. Even the smallest acts of kindness can create **lifelong memories and happiness.**

<item><![CDATA[
Once upon a time, a good many years ago, there was a <b>traveler</b>, and he set out upon a journey. It was a <b>magical journey</b>, and it was to seem very long when he began it and very short when he got halfway through.<br><br>

He traveled along a rather dark path for some time without meeting anyone until, at last, he came across a <b>beautiful child</b>. So he said to the child, "What do you do here?" And the child replied, "I am always at play. Come and play with me!"<br><br>

So, he played with that child the whole day long, and they were very merry. The sky was so blue, the sun was so bright, the water was so sparkling, the leaves were so green, and the flowers were so lovely. They heard such singing birds and saw so many butterflies that everything seemed magical. This was in fine weather. When it rained, they loved to watch the falling drops and to smell the fresh scents. When it blew, it was delightful to listen to the wind and imagine what it whispered as it came rushing from its home—wherever that might be—whistling and howling, driving the clouds before it, bending the trees, rumbling in the chimneys, shaking the house, and making the sea roar in fury. But, when it snowed, that was best of all; they loved nothing more than to watch the white flakes falling fast and thick, like down from the breasts of millions of white birds, and to see how smooth and deep the drift was, listening to the hush upon the paths and roads.<br><br>

They had the finest toys in the world and the most astonishing picture books, filled with tales of <b>scimitars, slippers, turbans, dwarfs, giants, genies, fairies</b>, and all sorts of wonders. But one day, suddenly, the <b>traveler</b> lost the child. He called to him over and over again, but there was no answer. So, he continued on his road, traveling a little while without meeting anyone, until at last, he came to a <b>handsome boy</b>. "What do you do here?" he asked. And the boy replied, "I am always learning. Come and learn with me."<br><br>

So, he learned with that boy about <b>Jupiter and Juno, the Greeks and the Romans</b>, and many other things—so much that he soon forgot a great deal of it. But they were not always learning; they had the <b>merriest games</b> ever played. They rowed upon the river in summer and skated on the ice in winter. They played <b>cricket</b> and other games, ran footraces, and rode on horseback. They had wonderful holidays with <b>Twelfth cakes, parties, and real theaters</b> where golden palaces rose from the earth, revealing the world\'s wonders. They had so many dear friends that it would take too long to count them all, and they promised never to be strangers to one another all their lives.<br><br>

Yet, one day, in the midst of all these pleasures, the <b>traveler</b> lost the boy, just as he had lost the child. He called to him in vain, then went on his journey once more. After a while, he met a <b>young man</b>. "What do you do here?" he asked. The young man replied, "I am always in love. Come and love with me."<br><br>

So, he went along with that young man until they met one of the <b>prettiest girls</b> ever seen—just like <b>Fanny</b>. She had <b>eyes like Fanny, hair like Fanny</b>, and dimples just like Fanny’s. She laughed and blushed exactly as Fanny did. The young man fell in love at once, just as <b>somebody</b> had done before. They teased each other, quarreled, made up, wrote letters every day, and were never happy apart. They were engaged at Christmas-time, sat close by the fire, and were soon to be married—just like <b>Fanny</b> and <b>somebody</b>!<br><br>

But, the <b>traveler</b> lost them one day, as he had lost the rest of his friends. Though he called out for them, they never returned. So he continued his journey until he met a <b>middle-aged gentleman</b>. "What do you do here?" he asked. "I am always busy. Come and be busy with me!" the man replied.<br><br>

So, he began working with that gentleman, traveling through the woods together. The whole journey was through a <b>forest</b>—once green like spring, now thick and dark like summer. Some of the earliest trees had already turned brown. The gentleman was not alone; he had a wife and children with him. Together, they cut down trees, cleared paths, carried burdens, and worked hard.<br><br>

Sometimes, they heard a small voice crying, "<b>Father, father, I am another child! Stop for me!</b>" Then, a little figure would appear, running to join them. They would crowd around, kiss and welcome the child, then continue their journey. At other times, the children would say, "<b>Father, I am going to sea, to India, to seek my fortune, or to Heaven!</b>" And so, with many tears, they parted. The child who went to Heaven rose into the golden air and disappeared.<br><br>

As these partings happened, the <b>traveler</b> noticed the gentleman\'s hair turning gray. But they kept moving, always busy. Finally, only the gentleman, his wife, and the <b>traveler</b> remained. The forest turned yellow, then brown, and leaves fell from the trees.<br><br>

One day, the lady stopped and said, "<b>My husband, I am called.</b>" They listened and heard a distant voice crying, "<b>Mother, mother!</b>" It was the first child who had gone to Heaven. The father pleaded, "<b>I pray not yet. The sunset is near. I pray not yet!</b>" But the voice continued to call, and though tears were on his face, his wife kissed him and said, "<b>My dearest, I am summoned, and I go!</b>" And she was gone. The <b>traveler</b> and the gentleman were left alone.<br><br>

They traveled on until they reached the end of the forest. The sunset shone red through the trees. Suddenly, the <b>traveler</b> lost his friend. Though he called out, there was no reply. As he passed out of the woods, he saw an <b>old man</b> sitting on a fallen tree. "What do you do here?" he asked. The old man smiled and said, "<b>I am always remembering. Come and remember with me.</b>"<br><br>

So, the <b>traveler</b> sat down beside the old man, facing the peaceful sunset. All his friends came softly back: the beautiful child, the handsome boy, the young man in love, the father, mother, and children. None were truly lost. He loved them all and was kind and patient with them. And they, in turn, honored and loved him. <br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b> Life is a journey filled with different stages, each bringing its own joys and sorrows. While we may lose people along the way, love, memories, and kindness endure forever.

<item><![CDATA[
He lived on the bank of a mighty river, broad and deep, which was always silently rolling on to a vast, undiscovered ocean. It had rolled on ever since the world began. It had sometimes changed its course and turned into new channels, leaving its old ways dry and barren, but it had ever been upon the flow and was always to flow until Time should be no more. Against its strong, unfathomable stream, nothing prevailed. No living creature, no flower, no leaf, no particle of animate or inanimate existence ever strayed back from the undiscovered ocean. The tide of the river set resistlessly towards it, and the tide never stopped, any more than the earth stops in its circling round the sun.<br><br>

He lived in a busy place, and he worked very hard to survive. He had no hope of ever being rich enough to live a month without hard work, but he was quite content, <b>GOD knows</b>, to labor with a cheerful will. He was one of an immense family, all of whose sons and daughters earned their daily bread by daily work, prolonged from their rising up at dawn until their lying down at night. Beyond this destiny, he had no prospect, and he sought none.<br><br>

There was excessive drumming, trumpeting, and speech-making in the neighborhood where he lived, but he had nothing to do with that. Such clash and uproar came from the <b>Bigwig family</b>, at whose unaccountable proceedings he marveled much. They set up the strangest statues, in iron, marble, bronze, and brass, before his door and darkened his house with the legs and tails of uncouth images of horses. He wondered what it all meant, smiled in a rough, good-humored way, and kept at his hard work.<br><br>

The <b>Bigwig family</b> (composed of all the stateliest and noisiest people thereabouts) had undertaken to save him the trouble of thinking for himself and to manage his affairs. "Why, truly," said he, "I have little time upon my hands; and if you will be so good as to take care of me in return for the money I pay over"—for the <b>Bigwig family</b> was not above his money—"I shall be relieved and much obliged, considering that you know best." Hence the drumming, trumpeting, and speech-making, and the ugly images of horses he was expected to fall down and worship.<br><br>

"I don’t understand all this," said he, rubbing his furrowed brow confusedly. "But it <b>has</b> a meaning, maybe, if I could find it out."

"It means," returned the <b>Bigwig family</b>, suspecting something of what he said, "honor and glory in the highest, to the highest merit."

"Oh!" said he. And he was glad to hear that.<br><br>

But when he looked among the statues of iron, marble, bronze, and brass, he failed to find a rather meritorious countryman of his—once the son of a Warwickshire wool-dealer—or any single countryman of that kind. He could find none of the men whose knowledge had rescued him and his children from terrifying diseases, whose boldness had raised his forefathers from the condition of serfs, whose wise imagination had opened a new and high existence to the humblest, whose skill had filled the working man’s world with accumulated wonders. Instead, he found others whom he knew no good of, and even some whom he knew much ill of.<br><br>

"Humph!" said he. "I don’t quite understand it."

So, he went home and sat down by his fireside to get it out of his mind.<br><br>

His fireside was bare, hemmed in by blackened streets, but it was precious to him. The hands of his wife were hardened with toil, and she was old before her time; but she was dear to him. His children, stunted in their growth, bore traces of unwholesome nurture; but they had beauty in his sight. Above all else, it was his earnest desire that his children should be taught. "If I am sometimes misled," said he, "for want of knowledge, at least let them know better and avoid my mistakes. If it is hard for me to reap the harvest of pleasure and instruction stored in books, let it be easier for them."

But the <b>Bigwig family</b> broke into violent quarrels over what was lawful to teach his children. Some insisted on one subject being primary and indispensable above all else; others insisted on another. The <b>Bigwig family</b>, rent into factions, wrote pamphlets, held convocations, delivered speeches, threw dirt, exchanged blows, and fought bitterly in unintelligible animosity. Meanwhile, this man, in his short evening moments at his fireside, saw the demon <b>Ignorance</b> rise and take his children. He saw his daughter become a heavy, slatternly drudge; he saw his son descend into low sensuality, brutality, and crime; he saw the dawning light of intelligence in his babies\' eyes turn into cunning and suspicion. He could have rather wished them idiots.<br><br>

"I don’t understand this any better," said he, "but I think it cannot be right. By the clouded Heaven above me, I protest against this as my wrong!"

Becoming peaceable again, for his passion was usually short-lived, he looked around on his Sundays and holidays and saw how much monotony and weariness existed. From that, he saw how drunkenness arose with all its ruin. He appealed to the <b>Bigwig family</b> and said, "We are a laboring people, and I have a suspicion that laboring people were made—by a higher intelligence than yours—to need mental refreshment and recreation. See what we fall into when we rest without it. Come! Amuse me harmlessly, show me something, give me an escape!"

But here, the <b>Bigwig family</b> erupted in uproar. When some few voices faintly suggested showing him the wonders of the world, nature, and art, a shrill wind of parliamentary questioning and weak replies arose, so that the poor fellow stood aghast.<br><br>

"Have I provoked all this," said he, with his hands to his affrighted ears, "by what was meant to be an innocent request, plainly arising out of my common experience? I don’t understand, and I am not understood. What is to come of such a state of things?"

He was bending over his work, often asking himself this question when the news spread that a <b>pestilence</b> had appeared among the laborers, slaying them by the thousands.<br><br>

**Moral of the Story:**<br>
The neglect and ignorance of the working class lead to widespread suffering, not just among them but throughout society. When education, health, and fair opportunities are denied to the poor, the consequences extend far beyond them. True progress and well-being require unity, responsibility, and care for all. In the end, the fate of "Nobody" is the fate of us all.

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between rolling green hills, there lived a young girl named Elara. She was known for her kindness and curiosity, always eager to learn about the world beyond her quiet home. One day, while exploring the forest at the edge of the village, she stumbled upon an old, forgotten path overgrown with ivy and wildflowers.

Intrigued, Elara followed the path, her heart pounding with excitement. The deeper she ventured, the more the air seemed to shimmer with magic. At last, she reached a clearing where an ancient oak tree stood, its massive branches sheltering a small, ornate door embedded in its trunk.

With a deep breath, Elara pushed the door open and stepped inside. To her amazement, she found herself in a vast library, its shelves lined with books that glowed softly in the dim light. A gentle voice called out, and from behind a tall stack of books emerged an elderly woman with silver hair and wise, twinkling eyes.

"Welcome, child," the woman said warmly. "You have found the Library of Lost Knowledge. Only those with true curiosity may enter."

Elara\'s eyes widened. "What is this place?"

The woman smiled. "This library holds the wisdom of the ages—forgotten stories, ancient spells, and truths yet to be rediscovered. You may read and learn, but you must promise to use this knowledge wisely."

Elara eagerly agreed, and so began her journey of discovery. She spent countless days poring over books, learning about forgotten legends, lost civilizations, and the secrets of the stars. As time passed, she grew into a wise young woman, using her newfound knowledge to help her village thrive.

One evening, as she was reading a particularly ancient tome, she found a passage about a hidden spring with water that could heal any illness. Remembering the sickness that had plagued her village, she set out to find it. Guided by the book’s cryptic directions, she navigated through dense forests, climbed treacherous cliffs, and crossed roaring rivers.

At last, she found the spring, its water shimmering under the moonlight. She filled a small vial and hurried back to her village. With careful hands, she gave the water to the sick, watching in wonder as their strength returned and their fevers vanished.

Word of Elara’s wisdom and kindness spread far and wide. She became a guardian of knowledge, teaching others and preserving the lost wisdom of the world. And though she often returned to the enchanted library, she knew that true magic lay not just in books, but in sharing what she had learned.

And so, Elara’s story became one of legend—a tale of curiosity, kindness, and the endless pursuit of knowledge that would never be forgotten.

Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the <b>Giant’s garden</b>.<br><br>

It was a large, lovely garden with soft green grass. Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach trees that, in the springtime, broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl. In the autumn, they bore rich fruit. The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games to listen. "<b>How happy we are here!</b>" they cried to each other.<br><br>

One day, the <b>Giant</b> came back. He had been to visit his friend, the <b>Cornish Ogre</b>, and had stayed with him for seven years. After the seven years were over, he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he decided to return to his own castle. When he arrived, he saw the children playing in his garden.<br><br>

"<b>What are you doing here?</b>" he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.<br><br>

"<b>My own garden is my own garden</b>," said the <b>Giant</b>. "Anyone can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself." So he built a high wall all around it and put up a notice board:<br><br>

<b>TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED</b><br><br>

He was a very <b>selfish Giant</b>.<br><br>

The poor children now had nowhere to play. They tried to play on the road, but it was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. They used to wander around the high wall after their lessons and talk about the beautiful garden inside. "<b>How happy we were there,</b>" they said to each other.<br><br>

Then spring came, and all over the country, there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the garden of the <b>Selfish Giant</b>, it was still winter. The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once, a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice board, it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again and went off to sleep. The only ones who were pleased were the <b>Snow</b> and the <b>Frost</b>. "<b>Spring has forgotten this garden,</b>" they cried, "<b>so we will live here all year round.</b>"<br><br>

The <b>Snow</b> covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the <b>Frost</b> painted all the trees silver. Then they invited the <b>North Wind</b> to stay with them, and he came. He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, blowing the chimney pots down. "<b>This is a delightful spot,</b>" he said. "<b>We must ask the Hail to visit.</b>" So the <b>Hail</b> came. Every day, for three hours, he rattled on the roof of the castle until he broke most of the slates. Then he ran around the garden as fast as he could go. He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.<br><br>

"<b>I cannot understand why spring is so late in coming,</b>" said the <b>Selfish Giant</b> as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden. "<b>I hope there will be a change in the weather.</b>"<br><br>

But spring never came, nor did summer. The <b>Autumn</b> gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the <b>Giant’s</b> garden, she gave none. "<b>He is too selfish,</b>" she said. So it was always winter there, and the <b>North Wind</b>, the <b>Hail</b>, the <b>Frost</b>, and the <b>Snow</b> danced about through the trees.<br><br>

One morning, the <b>Giant</b> was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the <b>King’s musicians</b> passing by. It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it had been so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him the most beautiful music in the world. Then the <b>Hail</b> stopped dancing over his head, the <b>North Wind</b> ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open window.<br><br>

"<b>I believe spring has come at last,</b>" said the <b>Giant</b>, and he jumped out of bed and looked out.<br><br>

**[Rest of the story continues as per the original with grammatical corrections.]**<br><br>

**Moral of the Story:**<br><br>

1. **Selfishness leads to loneliness, while kindness brings joy and warmth.**<br><br>
2. **Sharing and love transform both the giver and the receiver.**<br><br>
3. **True happiness comes from making others happy.**<br><br>
4. **Acts of kindness and generosity are rewarded in unexpected ways.**<br><br>

There were once <b>five-and-twenty tin soldiers</b>. They were all brothers, born of the same old tin spoon. They shouldered their muskets and looked straight ahead of them, splendid in their uniforms, all red and blue.<br><br>

The very first thing in the world that they heard was, <b>"Tin soldiers!"</b> A small boy shouted it and clapped his hands as the lid was lifted off their box on his birthday. He immediately set them up on the table.<br><br>

All the soldiers looked exactly alike except one. He looked a little different as he had been cast last of all. The tin was short, so he had only <b>one leg</b>. But there he stood, as steady on one leg as any of the other soldiers on their two. <b>"But just you see, he’ll be the remarkable one."</b><br><br>

On the table with the soldiers were many other playthings, and one that no eye could miss was a <b>marvelous castle</b> of cardboard. It had little windows through which you could look right inside it. And in front of the castle were <b>miniature trees</b> around a little mirror supposed to represent a lake. The wax swans that swam on its surface were reflected in the mirror. All this was very pretty, but <b>prettiest of all</b> was the little lady who stood in the open doorway of the castle. Though she was a <b>paper doll</b>, she wore a dress of the fluffiest gauze. A tiny <b>blue ribbon</b> went over her shoulder for a scarf, and in the middle of it shone a spangle that was as big as her face. The little lady held out both her arms, as a <b>ballet dancer</b> does, and one leg was lifted so high behind her that the tin soldier couldn’t see it at all, and he supposed she must have only <b>one leg</b>, as he did.<br><br>

<b>"That would be a wife for me,"</b> he thought. <b>"But maybe she’s too grand. She lives in a castle. I have only a box, with four-and-twenty roommates to share it. That’s no place for her. But I must try to make her acquaintance."</b> Still as stiff as when he stood at attention, he lay down on the table behind a snuffbox, where he could admire the <b>dainty little dancer</b> who kept standing on one leg without ever losing her balance.<br><br>

When the evening came, the other tin soldiers were put away in their box, and the people of the house went to bed. Now the toys began to play among themselves at visits, and battles, and at giving balls. The tin soldiers rattled about in their box, for they wanted to play too, but they could not get the lid open. The nutcracker turned somersaults, and the slate pencil squeaked out jokes on the slate. The toys made such a noise that they woke up the canary bird, who made them a speech, all in verse. The only two who stayed still were the <b>tin soldier</b> and the <b>little dancer</b>. Without ever swerving from the tip of one toe, she held out her arms to him, and the tin soldier was just as steadfast on his one leg. Not once did he take his eyes off her.<br><br>

Then the clock struck twelve and - <b>clack!</b> - up popped the lid of the snuffbox. But there was no snuff in it, no—out bounced a little black bogey, a <b>jack-in-the-box</b>.<br><br>

<b>"Tin soldier,"</b> he said. <b>"Will you please keep your eyes to yourself?"</b> The tin soldier pretended not to hear.<br><br>

The bogey said, <b>"Just you wait till tomorrow."</b><br><br>

But when morning came, and the children got up, the soldier was set on the <b>window ledge</b>. And whether the bogey did it, or there was a <b>gust of wind</b>, all of a sudden the window flew open and the soldier pitched out headlong from the third floor. He fell at breathtaking speed and landed cap first, with his bayonet buried between the paving stones and his <b>one leg</b> stuck straight in the air. The housemaid and the little boy ran down to look for him, and though they nearly stepped on the tin soldier, they walked right past without seeing him. If the soldier had called, <b>"Here I am!"</b> they would surely have found him, but he thought it contemptible to raise an uproar while he was wearing his uniform.<br><br>

The story continues with the soldier\'s journey through the rain, his adventure on the paper boat, his encounter with the rat, and ultimately, his tragic end in the fire.<br><br>

---

<b>Moral of the Story:</b><br><br>

The tale of the steadfast tin soldier teaches us the virtues of <b>courage, love, and perseverance</b>. Despite the hardships he faced, he remained resolute and faithful to his love. The story also highlights the unpredictability of fate and how true love and devotion remain unshaken even in the face of adversity. Ultimately, it is a reminder that <b>true strength lies in unwavering commitment and a steadfast heart</b>.

I am a *poor relation*. I don’t complain of my condition. I know it is the general lot of mankind, and I accept it. I strive to be contented. I try to make friends, but it is difficult when you are a *poor relation*.<br><br>

In my youth, I had bright hopes and big dreams. I was ambitious, hardworking, and full of life. But fate had other plans. A series of misfortunes left me with little more than my dignity. My friends, who once celebrated my successes, disappeared when I had nothing left to offer. My relatives, though kind in words, saw me as a burden. Their charity came with an unspoken obligation—to be grateful, to be humble, to be silent.<br><br>

I have always carried myself with dignity. I do not ask for much, only the respect that every man deserves. But in their eyes, I am merely a *poor relation*. I am tolerated at family gatherings, spoken to with pity, and treated as an afterthought. My words hold little weight, and my presence is easily forgotten.<br><br>

Still, I hold my head high. I refuse to be bitter. Life has taught me that wealth and status are fleeting, but kindness and integrity endure. Though I may be a *poor relation*, I am rich in experience, in wisdom, and in the knowledge that my worth is not measured by my possessions.<br><br>

**Moral of the Story:** True wealth lies not in material possessions but in dignity, self-respect, and kindness. People may judge you by your status, but your character defines your true worth.

<item><![CDATA[
Time was, with most of us, when <b>Christmas Day</b>, encircling all our limited world like a magic ring, left nothing out for us to miss or seek; bound together all our home enjoyments, affections, and hopes; grouped everything and everyone around the <b>Christmas fire</b>; and made the little picture, shining in our bright young eyes, complete.<br><br>

Time came, perhaps all too soon, when our thoughts over-leaped that narrow boundary; when there was someone (very dear, we thought then, very beautiful, and absolutely perfect) whose presence was essential to the fullness of our happiness. When we, too, were wanted (or so we believed, which was just as well) at the Christmas hearth by which that someone sat. And when we intertwined with every wreath and garland of our life that someone’s name.<br><br>

That was the time for the bright, visionary <b>Christmases</b>, which have long since faded into the misty edges of memory, much like the faint hues of a rainbow after a summer rain! That was the time for the blissful anticipation of things that were to be, yet never were—yet were so real in our steadfast hopes that it would be difficult to say now what realities achieved since have been stronger!<br><br>

What! Did that Christmas never truly come when we and the priceless pearl of our youthful choice were received—after the happiest of utterly impossible marriages—by two families previously at odds over our love? When brothers and sisters-in-law, once indifferent, suddenly adored us? When fathers and mothers overwhelmed us with unlimited blessings? Was that Christmas dinner never truly eaten, after which we rose and, with generous eloquence, honored our once-rival, now a friend, sealing a lifelong bond of respect? Has that same rival long since ceased to care for that once-prized pearl, married for wealth, and become hardened and mercenary? And above all, do we now truly know that, had we won and worn the pearl, we might have been miserable—and that we are, in fact, better without her?<br><br>

That Christmas, when we had recently achieved fame; when we had been triumphantly carried home for some great and noble deed; when we had won an honored and ennobled name and arrived amidst joyous tears—has that Christmas not yet come?<br><br>

And is our life, at its best, so structured that, as we reach these notable milestones, we look back upon dreams unfulfilled as naturally and as solemnly as upon the things that have been and are gone—or upon those that have endured? If so, and so it seems to be, must we conclude that life is little more than a dream, scarcely worth the loves and struggles we pour into it?<br><br>

No! Let not such misnamed philosophy take hold of us, dear Reader, on <b>Christmas Day</b>! Let the Christmas spirit—one of active usefulness, perseverance, cheerful duty, kindness, and forbearance—be near and dear to our hearts! Especially in these virtues, we are, or should be, strengthened by the unrealized visions of our youth; for who shall say that they do not teach us to be gentle even with the intangible dreams of this world?<br><br>

Therefore, as we grow older, let us be thankful that the circle of our <b>Christmas</b> memories and the lessons they bring expands! Let us welcome them all and bid them take their places by the <b>Christmas hearth</b>.<br><br>

Welcome, old aspirations, glittering figments of ardent fancy, to your place beneath the holly! We know you well and have not yet outlived you. Welcome, old projects and old loves, fleeting as they may have been, to your places among the steady lights that now burn around us. Welcome, all that was ever real to our hearts; and for the sincerity that made you real, thanks to Heaven! Do we build no <b>Christmas castles in the clouds</b> now? Let our thoughts, fluttering among these joyful children, bear witness!<br><br>

Before this young boy, there stretches out a future brighter than we ever dared to imagine in our own youthful days—bright with honor and truth. Around this little head, where golden curls are heaped, the graces play as airily as when our first love’s curls were untouched by time. And upon another face nearby—more placid, yet smiling with quiet contentment—we see the word <b>Home</b> clearly written. Shining from that word, as rays from a star, we perceive how, when our own graves are old, new hopes will rise, new hearts will stir, new paths will smooth, and new joys will blossom—never to decay, but to live on in other homes and through other children yet to be born!<br><br>

Welcome, everything! Welcome alike what has been, what never was, and what we still hope may be. Let them all gather beneath the holly, around the <b>Christmas fire</b>, where the present sits with an open heart!<br><br>

On this day, we shut out nothing!<br><br>

Pause, says a low voice. Nothing? Think!<br><br>

On <b>Christmas Day</b>, we will shut out from our fireside nothing—not even the shadows of those no longer with us.<br><br>

Not the shadow of the vast City, where the withered leaves lie deep? the voice asks. Not the shadow that darkens the entire world? Not the shadow of the <b>City of the Dead</b>?<br><br>

Not even that. Of all days in the year, we will turn our faces toward that City on <b>Christmas Day</b>, and from its silent hosts bring those we loved among us. In the sacred name in which we gather, in the presence that is here among us according to the promise, we will receive, not dismiss, those dear to us!<br><br>

Yes, we can look upon these angelic children—who alight so solemnly and beautifully among the living children by the fire—and bear to think how they left us. Like the patriarchs who entertained angels unawares, the playful children are unconscious of their ethereal guests; but we see them—we see a radiant arm around one child’s neck, as if gently beckoning them away.<br><br>

There was a brave boy who fell on a distant battlefield beneath a burning sun, who, with his last breath, sent his love home, wishing only to kiss his family one last time. Another was committed to the deep, his body sinking into the lonely ocean as the ship sailed on. Another rested in the dark shadow of great forests, never to wake again. Shall they not be brought home in spirit on this night?<br><br>

There was a dear girl—almost a woman—who left an aching void in a house of joy, vanishing into the silent City. Do we recall her, frail and whispering, slipping into her final sleep from sheer weariness? Oh, look upon her now! Look upon her beauty, her serenity, her eternal youth, her happiness! The daughter of Jairus was recalled to life, only to die again; but she, more blessed, has heard the same voice saying unto her, <b>Arise forever!</b><br><br>

Lost friends, lost children, lost parents, lost siblings, lost lovers—shall we exclude them from our <b>Christmas remembrance</b>? Would they have so excluded us? No! They shall hold their cherished places in our <b>Christmas hearts</b> and by our <b>Christmas fires</b>. And in this season of immortal hope, on this birthday of divine mercy, we will shut out nothing!<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b> <br>
Christmas is a time for love, remembrance, and inclusion. It reminds us to cherish the past, embrace the present, and hope for the future. No memory is too small, no love too distant, and no loss too great to be excluded from the warmth of our hearts on this sacred day. Let kindness, forgiveness, and the spirit of togetherness reign in our homes and hearts.<br><br>

<item><![CDATA[<b>The Power of Unity</b>

Once upon a time, there was a <b>flock of doves</b> that flew in search of food, led by their <b>king</b>. One day, after flying a long distance, they became <b>very tired</b>. The <b>dove king</b> encouraged them, saying, <b>"Fly a little further, and we will surely find food."</b>

<br><br>

The <b>smallest dove</b> picked up speed and soon spotted <b>some rice</b> scattered beneath a <b>banyan tree</b>. Excited, he called out to the others. All the doves <b>landed eagerly</b> and began to eat.

<br><br>

Suddenly, a <b>net fell over them</b>, trapping them. Panic spread through the flock as they saw a <b>hunter approaching</b> with a <b>huge club</b> in his hand. The doves desperately <b>fluttered their wings</b>, trying to escape, but it was <b>in vain</b>.

<br><br>

The <b>dove king</b> quickly came up with an idea. He said, <b>"We must all fly up together, carrying the net with us. There is strength in unity!"</b>

<br><br>

Each dove picked up a <b>portion of the net</b>, and with a <b>mighty effort</b>, they all flew up <b>at once</b>, carrying the net with them. The <b>hunter stood in astonishment</b>, watching them rise high into the sky. He tried to chase them, but they <b>soared over hills and valleys</b>, far beyond his reach.

<br><br>

The doves flew to a <b>hill near a city of temples</b>, where a <b>mouse</b> lived—a <b>faithful friend</b> of the dove king. Hearing the loud flapping of wings, the <b>mouse</b> ran into hiding. The <b>dove king</b> gently called out, <b>"My dear friend, it is me! Please come out."</b>

<br><br>

Recognizing the voice of his friend, the <b>mouse</b> came out happily. The <b>dove king</b> explained their situation and requested the <b>mouse</b> to <b>gnaw through the net</b> and set them free.

<br><br>

The <b>mouse agreed</b>, saying, <b>"I will free you first, Your Majesty."</b> But the <b>dove king</b> shook his head and said, <b>"No, free my subjects first. A king’s duty is to serve his people."</b>

<br><br>

The <b>mouse</b> understood the <b>king’s noble heart</b> and complied with his wishes. He began to chew through the <b>net</b>, freeing the doves <b>one by one</b>, and at last, he freed the <b>dove king</b>.

<br><br>

All the doves <b>thanked the mouse</b> and flew away, united in their strength and wisdom.

<item><![CDATA[<b>Birbal’s Wisdom</b>

King <b>Akbar</b> was very fond of <b>Birbal</b>. This made a certain <b>courtier</b> extremely jealous. The courtier had always dreamed of becoming the <b>chief minister</b>, but this was impossible as long as <b>Birbal</b> held the position.

<br><br>

One day, King <b>Akbar</b> praised <b>Birbal</b> in front of the jealous courtier. This made the courtier furious, and he said, <b>"Your Majesty, you praise Birbal unjustly. If he is truly as intelligent as you claim, let him answer three of my questions. If he succeeds, I will accept his wisdom."</b>

<br><br>

King <b>Akbar</b>, always eager to test <b>Birbal’s wit</b>, readily agreed. The courtier then posed his three questions:

<br><br>

How many stars are there in the sky?
Where is the center of the Earth?
How many men and how many women are there in the world?
<br><br>

King <b>Akbar</b> immediately summoned <b>Birbal</b> and presented the three questions. He warned that if <b>Birbal</b> could not answer them, he would have to <b>resign as chief minister</b>.

<br><br>

To answer the first question, <b>Birbal</b> brought a hairy sheep before the court and said, <b>"There are as many stars in the sky as there is hair on this sheep’s body. My friend, the courtier, is welcome to count them if he wishes."</b>

<br><br>

For the second question, <b>Birbal</b> drew a couple of lines on the ground and drove an iron rod into it. He then declared, <b>"This is the center of the Earth. The courtier may measure it himself if he has any doubts."</b>

<br><br>

Finally, in response to the third question, <b>Birbal</b> said, <b>"Counting the exact number of men and women in the world is difficult because there are some individuals, like our courtier friend here, who cannot easily be classified as either. If all such people are eliminated, then and only then can we determine the exact count."</b>

<br><br>

Hearing this, the courtier was left speechless, and King <b>Akbar</b> burst into laughter. Once again, <b>Birbal</b> had proven his intelligence.

<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> There is Always a Way.]]></item>"
<item><![CDATA[
<b>Birbal Outsmarts His Enemies</b>

As we all know, <b>Birbal</b> was not only Emperor <b>Akbar’s</b> favorite minister but also dearly loved by the commoners because of his wit and wisdom. People from far and wide came to him for advice, even on personal matters.

<br><br>

However, a group of ministers grew jealous of his popularity and disliked him intensely. Outwardly, they showered him with praise, but deep inside, they began plotting his downfall.

<br><br>

One day, they approached the king’s <b>barber</b> with a devious plan. Since the barber was extremely close to the king, they asked him to help get rid of <b>Birbal</b> permanently, promising him a huge sum of money in return. The wicked barber readily agreed.

<br><br>

The next time the king required his services, the barber started a conversation about the emperor’s late father, whom he had also served. He praised the former emperor’s fine, silky-smooth hair and then casually asked the king, <b>"Your Majesty, as you enjoy such great prosperity, have you done anything for the welfare of your ancestors?"</b>

<br><br>

The king was furious at this question and replied, <b>"How is that even possible? They are already dead!"</b>

<br><br>

The barber then mentioned that he knew a <b>magician</b> who could help. He claimed that the magician had the power to send a person up to heaven to inquire about the king’s father’s well-being. However, this person had to be <b>wise, intelligent, and responsible</b> enough to follow the magician’s instructions and make decisions. The barber then suggested the best candidate for the job—the wisest of all ministers, Birbal.

<br><br>

The king was thrilled at the idea of hearing from his father and immediately agreed to the plan. He asked the barber what needed to be done. The barber explained that <b>Birbal</b> would be taken in a grand procession to the burial grounds, where a pyre would be lit. The magician would chant special mantras, allowing <b>Birbal</b> to ascend to the heavens through the smoke. The chanting, he assured, would protect <b>Birbal</b> from the fire.

<br><br>

Excited, the king informed <b>Birbal</b> of the plan. <b>Birbal</b> pretended to be delighted and asked who had come up with such a brilliant idea. When he learned that it was the barber’s suggestion, he agreed to go to heaven—on two conditions.

<br><br>

<b>"First, I need a large sum of money for my long journey. Second, I require one month to settle my family’s affairs so they won’t struggle in my absence."</b>

<br><br>

The king agreed to both conditions.

<br><br>

During this month, <b>Birbal</b> instructed a few trusted men to dig a tunnel from the funeral grounds to his house. On the day of his "ascension," after the pyre was lit, he escaped through the concealed door of the tunnel and disappeared into his house, where he remained in hiding for several months. While in hiding, he let his hair and beard grow long and unruly.

<br><br>

Meanwhile, his enemies rejoiced, believing that they had finally gotten rid of him.

<br><br>

Then, after many months, <b>Birbal</b> dramatically returned to the palace with news from heaven. The king was overjoyed to see him and eagerly bombarded him with questions.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> assured the king, <b>"Your father is in the best of spirits. He has been provided with all the comforts, except one."</b>

<br><br>

The king asked, <b>"What is missing?"</b>

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> replied, <b>"There are no barbers in heaven, Your Majesty. That is why even I had to grow my beard. Your father has specifically requested a good barber."</b>

<br><br>

The king immediately decided to send his own barber to serve his father in heaven. He called the barber and the magician to prepare for the ritual.

<br><br>

The barber was speechless—he had been caught in his own trap! He could say nothing in his defense. Once the pyre was lit, he perished on the spot.

<br><br>

From that day on, no one dared to conspire against <b>Birbal</b> again.

<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> Intelligence and wisdom can defeat even the most cunning plots.

The emperor loved this curry so much that he took extreme care of the plants. The garden was well-guarded, and no one was allowed to see the plants without the emperor’s permission.

<br><br>

One day, the emperor arranged a grand dinner for his advisors, and the famous <b>brinjal curry</b> was served. <b>Tenali Rama</b> enjoyed the curry so much that he couldn\'t forget its taste even after returning home. He described the deliciousness of the dish to his wife.

<br><br>

Hearing this, Tenali Rama’s wife also wanted to taste the curry. She asked him to bring a few brinjals so that she could cook the same dish. However, Tenali Rama knew that the emperor took extreme precautions regarding these brinjals and could easily detect if even one was missing. He also knew that anyone caught stealing from the emperor’s garden would face severe punishment.

<br><br>

Despite this, Tenali Rama’s wife pleaded with him to bring the brinjals without telling anyone. Left with no choice, <b>Tenali Rama</b> decided to steal the brinjals.

<br><br>

One night, he sneaked into the garden, jumped over the wall, and plucked a few brinjals. By God’s grace, no one saw him. His wife cooked the brinjals, and the curry turned out to be as tasty as expected.

<br><br>

Like all mothers, Tenali Rama’s wife loved her son dearly. She wanted to share the curry with him, but Tenali Rama warned her not to do so. He feared that if their son mentioned having eaten the rare brinjal curry, they might get caught and punished.

<br><br>

However, his wife refused to eat the curry without serving their child, who was sleeping on the roof after doing his homework. She insisted that their son should also taste the delicious dish.

<br><br>

To prevent suspicion, <b>Tenali Rama</b> came up with a clever plan. He took a bucket of water, went to the roof, and poured it on his sleeping son. When the child woke up, Tenali Rama said, <b>"It is raining! Let’s go inside the house and have dinner."</b>

<br><br>

After taking him inside, Tenali Rama changed his son’s wet clothes and gave him rice with brinjal curry for dinner. He then loudly told his wife, <b>"It was raining outside, so let the boy sleep in the room."</b>

<br><br>

The next day, the emperor learned that a few brinjals were missing from his garden. The gardener, who kept count of every vegetable, reported that <b>three brinjals</b> were missing. The emperor took this matter seriously and announced a reward for anyone who could catch the thief.

<br><br>

The chief advisor, <b>Appaji</b>, suspected that only <b>Tenali Rama</b> was capable of doing such a thing. He informed the emperor about his suspicion, and the emperor immediately summoned <b>Tenali Rama</b>.

<br><br>

When asked about the missing brinjals, <b>Tenali Rama</b> innocently replied, <b>"I am not aware of any missing brinjals."</b>

<br><br>

The chief advisor then suggested questioning Tenali Rama’s son. The emperor agreed and sent his courtiers to bring the boy.

<br><br>

When the child arrived, he was asked what vegetable he had for dinner the previous night. The boy replied, <b>"Brinjal curry! And it was very tasty."</b>

<br><br>

Hearing this, the chief advisor turned to <b>Tenali Rama</b> and said, <b>"Now, accept your crime!"</b>

<br><br>

However, <b>Tenali Rama</b> remained calm and said, <b>"My son slept very early last night. He must be talking about something he saw in his dream."</b>

<br><br>

To confirm, the emperor asked the boy, <b>"Can you clearly explain what you did after coming home from school yesterday?"</b>

<br><br>

The boy replied, <b>"After coming home from school, I played for some time. Then I went to the roof, did my homework, and fell asleep. But later, it started raining. My father came and woke me up. My clothes were completely wet, so we went inside, had dinner, and then I went to sleep again."</b>

<br><br>

The chief advisor <b>Appaji</b> was shocked because there had been no rain the previous night—the weather had been completely dry! They assumed that the child had dreamed the entire event and decided to free <b>Tenali Rama</b> without any punishment.

<br><br>

Later, Tenali Rama revealed the truth to the emperor. The emperor, impressed by his wit and cleverness, forgave him.

<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> Stealing is never a good thing! However, intelligence and quick thinking can help you navigate difficult situations.

Once, Emperor <b>Akbar</b> was walking in his royal garden with his clever minister, <b>Birbal</b>. While they were talking, Akbar suddenly stopped and asked Birbal,

<br><br>

"Birbal, tell me—who is the most powerful person in my kingdom?"

<br><br>

Birbal smiled and replied, <b>"Your Majesty, of course, you are the most powerful!"</b>

<br><br>

Akbar was pleased with the answer but wanted to test Birbal’s intelligence further. So he asked,

"Then tell me, Birbal, is there anyone more powerful than me?"

Birbal thought for a moment and said, <b>"Yes, Your Majesty, there is someone even more powerful than you."</b>

Akbar was surprised. "Who is it?" he asked.

Birbal respectfully said, <b>"It is the person who controls you."</b>

Akbar laughed and said, "No one controls me! I am the Emperor!"

<br><br>

Birbal smiled and said, <b>"Your Majesty, tell me—if the Queen is angry with you, can you have a peaceful night?"</b>

Akbar laughed again and said, "You are right, Birbal! My Queen is indeed more powerful than me!"

<br><br>

Birbal wisely added, <b>"Yes, Your Majesty! A wise ruler knows that true power lies not in force, but in understanding the people who influence him."</b>

<br><br>

The next day, a <b>goat</b> happened to pass by. She peeped into the well and was surprised to see the fox inside.

<br><br>

"What are you doing down there, Mr. Fox?" the goat asked curiously.

<br><br>

The <b>sly fox</b> saw an opportunity and quickly came up with a plan. He replied, "Oh, I came here to drink water. It is the freshest and tastiest water I have ever had! You should come and try it too."

<br><br>

Without thinking twice, the <b>innocent goat</b> jumped into the well and quenched her thirst. But once she was done drinking, she realized that she <b>couldn’t get out</b>—just like the fox!

<br><br>

Now, the fox saw his chance to escape. He said, "I have an idea! You stand on your hind legs and rest your front legs against the wall. I will climb onto your back and jump out. Once I’m out, I will help you come out too!"

<br><br>

The goat, being simple and trusting, agreed to the fox’s plan. She positioned herself as instructed, and the <b>cunning fox quickly climbed up and leaped out of the well</b>.

<br><br>

Instead of keeping his promise, the fox <b>smirked and walked away</b>.

<br><br>

Before leaving, he turned back and said, "Had you been wise, you would have thought about how to get out before jumping in."

One day, he thought to himself, "Why should I wait for one egg every day? If I kill the hen, I can get all the golden eggs at once!"

<item><![CDATA[
Once upon a time, there lived a herd of <b>eighty thousand elephants</b> at the bottom of the majestic <b>Himalayas</b>. Their leader was a <b>magnificent and rare white elephant</b> who was an extremely <b>kind-hearted soul</b>. He greatly loved his <b>mother</b>, who had grown <b>blind and feeble</b> and could not look out for herself.

<br><br>

Each day, this <b>white elephant</b> would go deep into the forest in search of food. He would look for the <b>best wild fruit</b> to send to his mother. But <b>alas</b>, his mother never received any. This was because his <b>messengers would eat them up themselves</b>. Each night, when he returned home, he was <b>surprised</b> to hear that his mother had been <b>starving all day</b>. He was absolutely <b>disgusted with his herd</b>.

<br><br>

Then, one day, he decided to <b>leave them all behind</b> and disappeared in the <b>middle of the night</b> along with his dear <b>mother</b>. He took her to <b>Mount Candorana</b> to live in a cave beside a <b>beautiful lake</b> that was covered by <b>gorgeous pink lotuses</b>.

<br><br>

One day, while the <b>white elephant</b> was feeding, he heard <b>loud cries</b>. A <b>forester from Benaras</b> had <b>lost his way</b> in the forest and was absolutely <b>terrified</b>. Seeing the <b>big white elephant</b>, he became <b>even more frightened</b> and ran as fast as he could.

<br><br>

The <b>elephant</b> followed him and said, <b>"Do not be afraid. I only want to help you."</b> He asked the <b>forester</b> why he was crying so bitterly. The <b>forester</b> replied that he had been <b>roaming the forest for seven days</b> and could not find his way out.

<br><br>

The <b>elephant</b> reassured him and said, <b>"I know every inch of this forest. I will take you to safety."</b> He then <b>lifted him onto his back</b> and carried him to the edge of the forest, from where the <b>forester</b> made his way back to <b>Benaras</b>.

<br><br>

<b>The Forester\'s Greed</b>
<br><br>

When the <b>forester</b> reached <b>Benaras</b>, he heard that <b>King Brahmadutta’s personal elephant</b> had just <b>died</b> and that the <b>King was searching for a new royal elephant</b>. The King’s <b>heralds</b> were making an announcement:

<br><br>

<b>"Any man who has seen or heard of an elephant fit for a King should come forward with the information."</b>

<br><br>

The <b>forester</b>, now <b>greedy for a reward</b>, immediately went up to the <b>King</b> and told him about the <b>magnificent white elephant</b> on <b>Mount Candorana</b>. He even <b>offered to lead the King’s men</b> to the spot where the elephant lived.

<br><br>

The <b>King was pleased</b> and immediately dispatched a number of <b>soldiers and elephant trainers</b> along with the <b>forester</b>.

<br><br>

<b>The Elephant\'s Capture</b>
<br><br>

After traveling for many days, the group reached the <b>lake</b> where the white elephant lived. They <b>hid behind the bushes</b> while the <b>elephant</b> was collecting lotus shoots for his <b>mother’s meal</b>.

<br><br>

The <b>elephant sensed their presence</b> and saw the <b>forester</b> among them. He realized that the <b>forester had betrayed him</b>. He was <b>deeply hurt</b> by the man’s <b>ingratitude</b>.

<br><br>

But he thought to himself, <b>"If I put up a struggle, many men will be killed. I am too kind to hurt anyone."</b>

<br><br>

So, he <b>decided to go along</b> with them to <b>Benaras</b>, hoping that he could <b>convince the King</b> to <b>set him free</b>.

<br><br>

<b>The Elephant’s Sadness</b>
<br><br>

Meanwhile, the <b>white elephant</b> was taken to <b>Benaras</b>, where he was given a <b>grand welcome</b>. The entire <b>city was decorated</b>, and a <b>beautiful stable</b> was prepared for him, adorned with <b>fragrant flowers</b>.

<br><br>

The <b>trainers</b> laid out a <b>feast</b> for the new <b>state elephant</b>, but he <b>refused to eat</b>.

<br><br>

The <b>King</b> was <b>concerned</b> and went to visit the <b>elephant</b> himself. He offered him <b>food from the royal table</b> and asked, <b>"Why do you grieve, noble one? You should be honored to serve the King."</b>

<br><br>

The <b>white elephant</b> replied, <b>"O great King, I am not sad for myself. I grieve for my blind and helpless mother, who is starving on Mount Candorana. She will die without me."</b>

<br><br>

The <b>King</b>, deeply <b>moved by the elephant’s love</b>, declared, <b>"Go back to your mother. She needs you more than I do."</b>

<br><br>

He <b>set the white elephant free</b> out of <b>kindness and compassion</b>.

<br><br>

<b>The Elephant\’s Legacy</b>
<br><br>

The <b>white elephant</b> cared for his <b>mother</b> until the day she <b>passed away</b>. When he too <b>died</b>, the <b>King</b> built a <b>statue of him</b> beside the <b>lake</b> and held an <b>annual elephant festival</b> in his <b>honor</b>.

<item><![CDATA[A <b>10-year-old boy</b> decided to study <b>judo</b> despite the fact that he had <b>lost his left arm</b> in a <b>devastating car accident</b>.

<br><br>

The boy began lessons with an <b>old Japanese judo master</b>. He was <b>doing well</b>, but he couldn’t understand why—after <b>three months of training</b>—the master had taught him <b>only one move</b>.

<br><br>

<b>“Sensei,”</b> the boy finally said, <b>“Shouldn’t I be learning more moves?”</b>

<br><br>

<b>“This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you’ll ever need to know,”</b> the <b>sensei</b> replied.

<br><br>

Not quite understanding but <b>trusting his teacher</b>, the boy continued training.

<br><br>

<b>The Tournament Begins</b>
<br><br>

Several months later, the <b>sensei</b> took the boy to his <b>first tournament</b>. To his <b>own surprise</b>, the boy <b>easily won</b> his first two matches.

<br><br>

The <b>third match</b> was more <b>difficult</b>, but after some time, his <b>opponent became impatient</b> and <b>charged</b>. The boy <b>deftly used his one move</b> to <b>win the match</b>.

<br><br>

Still amazed by his success, the boy found himself in the <b>finals</b>.

<br><br>

<b>The Final Match</b>
<br><br>

This time, his <b>opponent</b> was <b>bigger, stronger, and more experienced</b>. For a while, the boy <b>appeared overmatched</b>.

<br><br>

Concerned that the boy <b>might get hurt</b>, the <b>referee</b> called a <b>time-out</b> and was about to <b>stop the match</b>.

<br><br>

But the <b>sensei intervened</b>.

<br><br>

<b>“No,”</b> the <b>sensei insisted</b>, <b>“Let him continue.”</b>

<br><br>

The match <b>resumed</b>. Soon after, the <b>boy’s opponent</b> made a <b>critical mistake</b>: he <b>dropped his guard</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Instantly</b>, the boy used <b>his move</b> to <b>pin him down</b>.

<br><br>

The boy had <b>won the match and the tournament</b>.

<br><br>

<b>The Lesson from the Sensei</b>
<br><br>

On the way home, the boy and <b>sensei</b> reviewed every <b>move in each match</b>. Then, the boy gathered the <b>courage</b> to ask what was really on his mind.

<br><br>

<b>“Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one move?”</b>

<br><br>

The <b>sensei</b> smiled and replied:

<br><br>

<b>“You won for two reasons. First, you’ve almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. And second, the only known defense for that move is for your opponent to grab your left arm.”</b>

<br><br>

The boy’s <b>biggest weakness</b> had become his <b>greatest strength</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b>
<b>Sometimes we feel that we have certain weaknesses and we blame God, circumstances, or ourselves for them. But we never know that our weaknesses can become our strengths one day. Each of us is special and important, so never think you have any weakness. Never think of pride or pain—just live your life to the fullest and extract the best out of it!</b>

Yes! He could see some <b>water inside the jug</b>!<br><br>

The <b>crow tried to push his head</b> into the jug. Sadly, he found that the <b>neck of the jug was too narrow</b>.<br><br>

Then he tried to <b>push the jug to tilt</b> for the water to flow out, but the <b>jug was too heavy</b>.<br><br>

Once, while returning with <b>loads of salt</b> on his back, Khandya <b>falls in the river</b>. He realizes that the fall has <b>lessened the weight</b> of the sacks as the salt has <b>dissolved</b> in the water.<br><br>

The next few days, Khandya <b>purposely falls into the water every day</b>.<br><br>

Bhola is <b>unhappy</b> at the way Khandya is behaving because he is <b>losing money</b> in the process. He decides to <b>teach Khandya a lesson</b>.<br><br>

The next day, instead of <b>salt bags</b>, he loads Khandya with <b>bags of cotton</b>. Khandya is <b>unaware</b> of the change.<br><br>

<item><![CDATA[A <b>water bearer</b> in India had <b>two large pots</b>, each hung on each end of a pole which he carried across his neck.<br><br>

One of the pots had a <b>crack</b> in it, and while the other pot was <b>perfect</b> and always delivered a <b>full portion of water</b> at the end of the long walk from the stream to the master\'s house, the <b>cracked pot</b> arrived only <b>half full</b>.<br><br>

For a full <b>two years</b> this went on daily, with the bearer delivering only <b>one and a half pots</b> full of water to his master\'s house.<br><br>

Of course, the <b>perfect pot</b> was proud of its accomplishments, perfect to the end for which it was made. But the <b>poor cracked pot</b> was <b>ashamed</b> of its own imperfection and <b>miserable</b> that it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do.<br><br>

After two years of what it perceived to be a <b>bitter failure</b>, it spoke to the <b>water bearer</b> one day by the stream.<br><br>

<b>"I am ashamed of myself, and I want to apologize to you."</b><br><br>

<b>"Why?"</b> asked the bearer. <b>"What are you ashamed of?"</b><br><br>

<b>"I have been able, for these past two years, to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your master\'s house. Because of my flaws, you have to do all of this work, and you don\'t get full value from your efforts,"</b> the pot said.<br><br>

The <b>water bearer</b> felt <b>sorry</b> for the old cracked pot, and in his <b>compassion</b> he said, <b>"As we return to the master\'s house, I want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path."</b><br><br>

Indeed, as they went up the hill, the <b>old cracked pot</b> took notice of the <b>sun warming the beautiful wildflowers</b> on the side of the path, and this <b>cheered</b> it somewhat.<br><br>

But at the end of the trail, it still <b>felt bad</b> because it had <b>leaked out half its load</b>, and so again it apologized to the bearer for its <b>failure</b>.<br><br>

The bearer said to the pot, <b>"Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of the path, but not on the other pot\'s side? That\'s because I have always known about your flaw, and I took advantage of it. I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk back from the stream, you\'ve watered them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my master\'s table. Without you being just the way you are, he would not have this beauty to grace his house."</b><br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> Each of us has our own <b>unique flaws</b>. We\'re all <b>cracked pots</b>. In this world, nothing goes to waste. You may think, like the cracked pot, that you are <b>inefficient or useless</b> in certain areas of your life, but somehow these flaws can turn out to be a <b>blessing in disguise</b>.<br><br>

One day a <b>farmer\'s donkey</b> fell down into a <b>well</b>.<br><br>

He invited all his <b>neighbors</b> to come over and help him. They all grabbed a <b>shovel</b> and began to shovel <b>dirt</b> into the well.<br><br>

At first, the <b>donkey</b> realized what was happening and cried <b>horribly</b>. Then, to everyone’s amazement, he <b>quieted down</b>.<br><br>

A few shovel loads later, the <b>farmer</b> finally looked down the well and was <b>astonished</b> at what he saw.<br><br>

<item><![CDATA[ A long time ago, there lived a <b>priest</b> who was extremely <b>lazy</b> and <b>poor</b> at the same time.<br><br>

He did not want to do any <b>hard work</b> but used to <b>dream of being rich</b> one day.<br><br>

He got his food by <b>begging for alms</b>.<br><br>

One morning, he got a <b>pot of milk</b> as part of the alms.<br><br>

He was extremely delighted and went home with the <b>pot of milk</b>.<br><br>

He <b>boiled</b> the milk, drank some of it, and put the remaining milk in a pot.<br><br>

He added slight <b>curds</b> in the pot to convert the milk into <b>curd</b>.<br><br>

He then lay down to sleep.<br><br>

Soon, he started <b>imagining</b> about the pot of curd while he lay asleep.<br><br>

He dreamed that if he could <b>become rich</b> somehow, all his miseries would be gone.<br><br>

His thoughts turned to the <b>pot of milk</b> he had set to form the curd.<br><br>

He dreamed on:
"By morning, the pot of milk would set, it would be converted to <b>curd</b>.<br><br>

I would <b>churn the curd</b> and make <b>butter</b> from it.<br><br>

I would heat the <b>butter</b> and make <b>ghee</b> out of it.<br><br>

I will then go to the <b>market</b> and sell that <b>ghee</b> to make some money.<br><br>

With that money, I will buy a <b>hen</b>.<br><br>

The <b>hen</b> will lay many <b>eggs</b> which will hatch, and soon, I will have <b>many chickens</b>.<br><br>

These <b>chickens</b> will, in turn, lay <b>hundreds of eggs</b>, and I will soon have a <b>poultry farm</b> of my own."<br><br>

He kept on imagining:<br><br>

"I will sell all the <b>hens</b> of my poultry and buy some <b>cows</b> and open a <b>milk dairy</b>.<br><br>

All the town people will buy <b>milk</b> from me.<br><br>

I will be <b>very rich</b> and soon I shall buy <b>jewels</b>.<br><br>

The <b>king</b> will buy all the <b>jewels</b> from me.<br><br>

I will be so <b>rich</b> that I will be able to <b>marry</b> an exceptionally <b>beautiful girl</b> from a <b>rich family</b>.<br><br>

Soon, I will have a <b>handsome son</b>.<br><br>

If he does any mischief, I will be very <b>angry</b> and to teach him a lesson, I will <b>hit him with a big stick</b>."<br><br>

During this dream, he involuntarily <b>picked up the stick</b> next to his bed, and thinking that he was <b>beating his son</b>, raised the stick and <b>hit the pot</b>.<br><br>

The <b>pot of milk broke</b>, and he awoke from his <b>daydream</b>.<br><br>

In the beginning, they all felt <b>sad</b> for the death of one of their colleagues, but after a while, they started getting <b>curious</b> to know who was that person who had hindered their growth and the company\'s progress.<br><br>

The <b>excitement</b> in the gym was so intense that <b>security agents</b> were ordered to control the crowd within the room.<br><br>

The more people reached the <b>coffin</b>, the more the excitement heated up.<br><br>

Everyone thought:

One by one, the <b>thrilled employees</b> got closer to the coffin, and when they looked inside, they suddenly became <b>speechless</b>.<br><br>

They stood nearby the coffin, <b>shocked</b> and in <b>silence</b>, as if someone had touched the deepest part of their soul.<br><br>

There was a <b>mirror</b> inside the coffin: everyone who looked inside it could see <b>themselves</b>.<br><br>

<b>Once upon a time</b>, a daughter complained to her father that her life was <b>miserable</b> and that she didn\'t know how she was going to make it. She was <b>tired</b> of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed that just as <b>one problem</b> was solved, <b>another</b> soon followed.<br><br>

Her father, a <b>chef</b>, took her to the kitchen. He filled <b>three pots</b> with water and placed each on a high fire.<br><br>

Once the three pots began to <b>boil</b>, he placed <b>potatoes</b> in one pot, <b>eggs</b> in the second pot, and <b>ground coffee beans</b> in the third pot. He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter.<br><br>

The daughter <b>moaned and impatiently waited</b>, wondering what he was doing.<br><br>

After twenty minutes, he turned off the burners. He took the <b>potatoes</b> out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He pulled the <b>eggs</b> out and placed them in a bowl. He then ladled the <b>coffee</b> out and placed it in a cup.<br><br>

Turning to her, he asked, <b>“Daughter, what do you see?”</b><br><br>

<b>“Potatoes, eggs, and coffee,”</b> she hastily replied.<br><br>

<b>“Look closer,”</b> he said, <b>“and touch the potatoes.”</b> She did and noted that they were <b>soft</b>.<br><br>

He then asked her to take an <b>egg</b> and <b>break</b> it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the <b>hard-boiled egg</b>.<br><br>

Finally, he asked her to <b>sip the coffee</b>. Its <b>rich aroma</b> brought a <b>smile</b> to her face.<br><br>

<b>“Father, what does this mean?”</b> she asked.<br><br>

He then explained that the <b>potatoes</b>, the <b>eggs</b>, and the <b>coffee beans</b> had each faced the same <b>adversity</b>—the <b>boiling water</b>. However, each one <b>reacted differently</b>.<br><br>

The <b>potato</b> went in <b>strong, hard, and unrelenting</b>, but in boiling water, it became <b>soft and weak</b>.<br>
The <b>egg</b> was <b>fragile</b>, with a thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior. But after being boiled, the inside became <b>hard</b>.<br>
The <b>ground coffee beans</b> were <b>unique</b>. After they were exposed to the boiling water, <b>they changed the water</b> and <b>created something new</b>.<br><br>
<b>“Which one are you?”</b> he asked his daughter. <b>“When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a potato, an egg, or a coffee bean?”</b><br><br>

<b>Moral:</b>
In life, things happen around us, things happen to us, but the only thing that truly matters is <b>how you choose to react</b> and <b>what you make out of it</b>. Life is all about <b>learning, adapting, and converting</b> all the struggles that we experience into something <b>positive</b>.<br><br>

<item><![CDATA[ I have a friend named <b>Monty Roberts</b> who owns a <b>horse ranch in San Isidro</b>. He has been kind enough to let me use his house for <b>fundraising events</b> to support <b>youth at risk programs</b>.

<br><br>

The last time I was there, Monty introduced me by saying:

<br><br>

“I want to tell you why I let Jack use my horse. It all goes back to a story about a <b>young man</b> who had a <b>dream</b>…”

<br><br>

<b>The Dream That Almost Got Stolen</b>
Once, there was a <b>young boy</b> who was the son of an <b>itinerant horse trainer</b>. His father traveled constantly—moving from <b>stable to stable, racetrack to racetrack, farm to farm, and ranch to ranch</b>—training horses. Because of this, the boy’s <b>high school career</b> was continually <b>interrupted</b>.

<br><br>

When he was a <b>senior</b>, his teacher assigned the class a paper:

<br><br>

"Write about what you want to be and do when you grow up."

<br><br>

That night, the boy poured his <b>heart</b> into a <b>seven-page paper</b>, detailing his <b>dream</b> of owning a <b>horse ranch</b> one day. He described his vision in <b>great detail</b> and even included a <b>diagram</b> of a <b>200-acre ranch</b>, marking the locations of <b>all the buildings, stables, and tracks</b>. He also sketched an <b>architectural plan</b> for a <b>4,000-square-foot house</b> that would sit on the ranch.

<br><br>

The next day, he submitted the paper.

<br><br>

<b>A Crushing Blow</b>
Two days later, the boy received his paper back. On the <b>front page</b> was a <b>large red "F"</b> with a note:

<br><br>

“See me after class.”

<br><br>

Confused and disappointed, the boy went to see his teacher after class and asked:

<br><br>

“Why did I receive an F?”

<br><br>

The teacher looked at him and said:

<br><br>

“This is an <b>unrealistic dream</b> for a boy like you. You have <b>no money</b>, you come from an <b>itinerant family</b>, and you have <b>no resources</b>. Owning a horse ranch requires a <b>lot of money</b>. You’d have to buy the land, purchase breeding stock, and later pay huge stud fees. There’s just <b>no way</b> you could ever do it.”

<br><br>

Then the teacher added:

<br><br>

“If you <b>rewrite</b> this paper with a <b>more realistic goal</b>, I will <b>reconsider</b> your grade.”

<br><br>

<b>The Crossroad</b>
The boy went home, devastated. He thought long and hard about what to do. He asked his <b>father</b> for advice.

<br><br>

His father simply said:

<br><br>

“Son, you have to <b>make up your own mind</b> on this. But I think it is a <b>very important decision</b> for you.”

<br><br>

The boy sat with his thoughts for a <b>week</b>. Finally, he <b>turned in the same paper</b>, making <b>no changes at all</b>.

<br><br>

He told the teacher:

<br><br>

“You can <b>keep the F</b>, and I’ll <b>keep my dream</b>.”

<br><br>

<b>The Dream Became Reality</b>
Monty then turned to the <b>assembled group</b> and smiled:

<br><br>

“I tell you this story because <b>you are sitting in my 4,000-square-foot house, in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch.</b>"

<br><br>

The room was silent. Then, he pointed to a <b>framed piece of paper</b> hanging above the fireplace.

<br><br>

"I still have that <b>school paper</b>, framed as a <b>reminder</b>."

<br><br>

But the story doesn’t end there.

<br><br>

<b>Two summers ago</b>, that <b>same teacher</b> brought <b>30 students</b> to camp out on Monty’s ranch for a week.

<br><br>

Before leaving, the teacher said to him:

<br><br>

“Monty, I can tell you this now. Back when I was your teacher, I was something of a <b>dream stealer</b>. I stole a lot of kids' dreams… But <b>fortunately, you had enough courage not to give up on yours.</b>”

<b>Birbal</b> was an advisor in the court of <b>Akbar</b> and is very popular for his sharp intellect and sense of humor. The stories of <b>Birbal</b> are very popular among kids and adults alike and form an indispensable part of Indian folklore.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal (1528-1583)</b> is surely one of the most popular figures in Indian history, equally regarded by adults and children. <b>Birbal’s</b> duties in <b>Akbar’s</b> court were mostly administrative and military, but he was a very close friend of <b>Akbar</b> too, because <b>Akbar</b> loved his wisdom, wit, and subtle humor. He was a minister in the administration of <b>Mughal Emperor Akbar</b> and one of the members of the inner council of nine advisors. He was a <b>poet and an author</b> too.

<br><br>

It is believed that he was a son of a poor <b>Brahman of Trivikrampur</b> (now known as <b>Tikavanpur</b>) on the banks of <b>River Yamuna</b>. According to a popular legend, he died on an <b>expedition to Afghanistan</b> at the head of a large military force due to <b>treachery</b>. It is also said that when <b>Birbal</b> died, <b>Akbar</b> mourned him for several months.

<br><br>

The exchanges between <b>Akbar and Birbal</b> have been recorded in many volumes. Many of these have become <b>folk stories</b> in Indian tradition. <b>Birbal’s</b> collection of poetry, published under the pen name <b>Brahm</b>, is preserved in <b>Bharatpur Museum, Rajasthan, India</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Mahesh Das\' Fortune – How They Met</b>

<br><br>

When <b>Mahesh</b> became a young man, he took <b>a few coins</b>, which were all his savings, along with the <b>Ring of the Royal Seal</b>, kissed his mother farewell, and set out upon the long road to the <b>new capital of the Empire, Fatehpur Sikri</b>.

<br><br>

He walked a long way and finally reached the <b>red walls of the palace</b>. The <b>palace gate</b> was so large and richly ornamented that <b>Mahesh</b> thought it must be the door to the <b>Emperor’s own room</b>. But it was far from that. Beautiful as it was, it was merely the <b>outermost edge</b> of the <b>great city within a city</b>, which was the <b>Imperial Court</b>.

<br><br>

Soon the <b>guard on duty</b> noticed the astonished gaze of this <b>simple-looking country boy</b>. He <b>slashed the air with his spear</b> and barred <b>Mahesh’s</b> path.

<br><br>

<b>"Where do you think you’re going?"</b> asked the guard.

<br><br>

<b>"I have come to see the King,"</b> said Mahesh mildly.

<br><br>

Making fun of him, the guard continued, <b>"Oh, have you? How very fortunate. His Majesty has been wondering when you would come."</b>

<br><br>

<b>Mahesh replied,</b> "Yes, well, now I’m here, let me pass."

<br><br>

<b>"Fool! Shenshah Akbar is very busy, Go away!"</b> The guard became furious and was about to hit him when <b>Mahesh held out Akbar’s ring</b>. Even a guard could recognize the <b>Imperial Seal</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Mahesh then said,</b> "Our good <b>King</b> receives all who come to see him. Many years ago, he had sent for me. Now let me pass."

<br><br>

The <b>guard was very annoyed</b> as now he had to let the young man pass, but he was unwilling to let him go.

<br><br>

<b>"You can pass on one condition,"</b> he scowled. <b>"If you obtain anything from the Emperor, you will give half to me."</b>

<br><br>

<b>"Agreed,"</b> smiled <b>Mahesh</b>, and went by.

<br><br>

<b>Meeting Emperor Akbar</b>

<br><br>

<b>Shade trees rocked with the breeze</b> as <b>Mahesh</b> followed the path through the <b>royal gardens</b>. Each <b>building he passed</b> seemed more <b>magnificent than the last</b>. Finally, he reached the <b>hall of the public audience</b>.

<br><br>

Seeing so many <b>richly dressed courtiers</b>, his heart pounded, feeling that he was <b>not properly dressed</b> to meet the <b>King</b>.

<br><br>

But at last, he saw <b>Akbar</b>, seated upon a <b>throne of gold</b> studded with <b>flashing gems</b>, a man of <b>simple elegance</b>. He needed to look no further.

<br><br>

<b>Mahesh Das\' Clever Trick</b>

<br><br>

<b>"What!"</b> exploded the <b>King</b>. <b>"A hundred lashes? But you have done nothing wrong!"</b>

<br><br>

<b>Mahesh then said,</b> "Will Your Majesty go back on his promise to fulfill my heart’s desire?"

<br><br>

<b>"Well, no – a King must always keep his word…,"</b> replied <b>Akbar</b>.

<br><br>

So, with great reluctance, <b>Akbar</b> ordered <b>Mahesh’s back to be stripped</b>, and <b>a hundred lashes</b> of the whip to be laid upon him by the <b>court executioner</b>.

<br><br>

To the <b>acute interest</b> of all the assembled <b>courtiers</b>, <b>Mahesh</b> endured every stroke with a <b>stony expression</b>, without uttering a sound.

<br><br>

But when the <b>whip had cracked for the fiftieth time (50th),</b> he suddenly <b>jumped up and shouted: "Stop!"</b>

<br><br>

<b>What happened? Why did Mahesh Das say STOP?</b>

<br><br>

<b>Mahesh Das smiled and said,</b> "No, Sire. It is only that when I came here to see you, I was unable to enter the <b>Palace</b>, unless I promised the <b>guard at the front gate</b> half of whatever I get from the <b>King’s generosity</b>. So I have taken half of the <b>hundred lashes</b>. Please be kind enough to deliver the rest of them to him."

<br><br>

The <b>entire crowd</b> burst into <b>laughter</b>, and <b>Akbar</b> laughed <b>loudest of all</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Akbar turned to Mahesh and said,</b>

<b>"You are a brave-heart like you were when you were a child, and you have grown even cleverer. From now on, since you are so wise, you shall be called ‘Birbal‘, the courageous one. And you shall stay by my side and advise me in all court matters."</b>

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>

<b>Wit, intelligence, and bravery</b> can outsmart <b>corruption and dishonesty</b>.
<b>Justice always prevails</b>.
<b>One should always be clever and fearless in the face of challenges</b>.

    <item><![CDATA[Before he became <b>Birbal</b>, he was known as <b>Maheshdas</b>, a poet and scholar from <b>Trivikrampur (present-day Kalpi, Uttar Pradesh)</b>. His intelligence and wit would eventually lead him to Emperor <b>Akbar’s</b> court, where he would become one of the <b>Navaratnas (Nine Gems)</b>.

<br><br>


Akbar’s First Test for Maheshdas
Akbar, in disguise as an ordinary traveler, approached <b>Maheshdas</b> and engaged him in conversation.

He asked, <b>"What is the biggest truth in this world?"</b>

<b>Maheshdas</b> smiled and replied, <b>"The biggest truth is that everything in this world changes, except for God and truth itself."</b>

<br><br>

<b>Akbar</b> was impressed by his answer but decided to test him further. He gave <b>Maheshdas</b> a <b>thin thread</b> and said,
<b>"Take this to my court in Agra and have it measured accurately."</b>

<b>Maheshdas</b>, sensing that the traveler was no ordinary man, simply replied,
<b>"This thread can only be measured correctly by the person who gave it to me."</b>

<br><br>

<b>Akbar</b> was astonished by his quick thinking and revealed his true identity. He invited <b>Maheshdas</b> to his court, where he continued to impress the emperor with his wisdom.

<br><br>

Akbar Names Him "Birbal"
After <b>Maheshdas</b> arrived at <b>Akbar’s court</b>, the emperor tested him with more <b>riddles and challenges</b>. Each time, he gave clever and thoughtful answers, making <b>Akbar</b> laugh and admire him.

Delighted by his intelligence, <b>Akbar</b> gave him the title "Birbal", meaning <b>"wise and brave"</b>, and made him an official <b>court advisor</b>.

<br><br>

From that day on, <b>Birbal</b> became <b>Akbar’s most trusted minister</b>, known for his <b>humor, problem-solving skills, and quick wit</b>. Their friendship and witty exchanges became legendary, and their stories are still told today as a symbol of <b>intelligence and wisdom</b>. ]]></item>
<item><![CDATA[<b>King Akbar</b> was very fond of <b>Birbal</b>. This made a certain <b>courtier</b> very jealous. Now, this courtier always wanted to be <b>chief minister</b>, but this was not possible as <b>Birbal</b> filled that position.

<br><br>

One day, <b>Akbar</b> praised <b>Birbal</b> in front of the courtier. This made the <b>courtier</b> very angry, and he said that the <b>King</b> praised <b>Birbal</b> unjustly. He challenged that if <b>Birbal</b> could answer three of his questions, he would accept that <b>Birbal</b> was truly intelligent.

<br><br>

<b>Akbar</b>, always eager to test <b>Birbal’s</b> wit, readily agreed.

<br><br>

<b>The Three Questions:</b>

<br><br>

<b>How many stars are there in the sky?</b>
<b>Where is the center of the Earth?</b>
<b>How many men and how many women are there in the world?</b>
<br><br>

Immediately, <b>Akbar</b> asked <b>Birbal</b> the three questions and informed him that if he could not answer them, he would have to <b>resign as chief minister</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal\'s Clever Answers:</b>

<br><br>

To answer the <b>first question</b>, <b>Birbal</b> brought a <b>hairy sheep</b> and said,

<b>"There are as many stars in the sky as there is hair on the sheep’s body. My friend, the courtier, is welcome to count them if he likes."</b>

<br><br>

To answer the <b>second question</b>, <b>Birbal</b> drew a couple of lines on the floor and bore an <b>iron rod</b> into it, saying,

<b>"This is the center of the Earth. The courtier may measure it himself if he has any doubts."</b>

<br><br>

In answer to the <b>third question</b>, <b>Birbal</b> said,

<b>"Counting the exact number of men and women in the world would be a problem as there are some specimens like our courtier friend here who cannot easily be classified as either.</b>

<b>Therefore, if all people like him are removed, then and only then can one count the exact number."</b>

<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> <b>There is Always a Way.</b>]]></item>"

<br><br>

One fine day, <b>Akbar</b> lost his <b>ring</b>. When <b>Birbal</b> arrived in the court, <b>Akbar</b> told him,

<b>"I have lost my ring. My father had given it to me as a gift. Please help me find it."</b>

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> said, <b>"Do not worry, Your Majesty, I will find your ring right now."</b>

<br><br>

He then said, <b>"Your Majesty, the ring is here in this court itself; it is with one of the courtiers. The courtier who has a straw in his beard has your ring."</b>

<br><br>

The <b>courtier</b> who had the <b>Emperor’s ring</b> was shocked and immediately moved his hand over his <b>beard</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> noticed this act of the <b>courtier</b>. He immediately pointed towards him and said,

<b>"Please search this man. He has the Emperor’s ring."</b>

<br><br>

<b>Akbar</b> could not understand how <b>Birbal</b> had managed to find the ring.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> then told <b>Akbar</b> that <b>a guilty person is always scared.</b>

<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> <b>A Guilty Conscience Needs No Accuser.</b>]]></item>"
<item><![CDATA[As we all know, <b>Birbal</b> was not only <b>Emperor Akbar’s</b> favorite minister but also a minister dearly loved by most of the commoners, because of his ready wit and wisdom. People used to come to him from far and wide for advice on personal matters too. However, there was a group of ministers that were jealous of his growing popularity and disliked him intensely. They outwardly showered him with praise and compliments, but on the inside, they began to hatch a plot to kill him.

<br><br>

One day, they approached the <b>king’s barber</b> with a plan. As the barber was extremely close to the king, they asked him to help them get rid of <b>Birbal</b> permanently. And of course, they promised him a huge sum of money in return. The wicked barber readily agreed.

<br><br>

The next time the king required his services, the barber started a conversation about the emperor’s father, whom he had also served. He sang praises of his fine, silky-smooth hair. And then, as an afterthought, he asked the king, <b>“As you are enjoying such great prosperity, have you made an attempt to do anything for the welfare of your ancestors?”</b>

<br><br>

The king was furious at such impertinent stupidity and told the barber that it was not possible to do anything because they were already dead.

<br><br>

The barber mentioned that he knew of a <b>magician</b> who could help. The magician could send a person up to <b>heaven</b> to enquire about his father’s welfare. But of course, this person would have to be chosen carefully; he would have to be <b>intelligent</b> enough to follow the magician\'s instructions as well as make on-the-spot decisions. He must be <b>wise, intelligent, and responsible</b>.

<br><br>

The barber then suggested the best person for the job – the wisest of all ministers, <b>Birbal</b>.

<br><br>

The king was very excited about hearing from his dead father and asked the barber to go ahead and make the arrangements immediately. He asked him what needed to be done.

<br><br>

The barber explained that they would take <b>Birbal</b> in a procession to the burial grounds and light a <b>pyre</b>. The magician would then chant some ‘<b>mantras</b>’ as <b>Birbal</b> would ascend to the heavens through the smoke. The chanting would help protect <b>Birbal</b> from the fire.

<br><br>

The king happily informed <b>Birbal</b> of this plan.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> said that he thought it was a brilliant idea and wanted to know the brain behind it. Upon learning that it was the barber’s idea, he agreed to go to heaven on one condition: he be given a large sum of money for the long journey as well as one month’s time to settle his family so that they had no trouble while he was gone.

<br><br>

The king agreed to both conditions.

<br><br>

During this month, <b>Birbal</b> got a few trustworthy men to build a <b>tunnel</b> from the funeral grounds to his house. And on the day of the ascension, after the pyre had been lit, <b>Birbal</b> escaped through the concealed door of the tunnel. He disappeared into his house, where he hid for a few months while his hair and beard grew long and unruly.

<br><br>

In the meantime, his <b>enemies</b> were rejoicing as they thought that they had seen the last of <b>Birbal</b>.

<br><br>

Then, one day, after many, many months, <b>Birbal</b> arrived at the palace with news of the king’s father.

<br><br>

The king was extremely pleased to see him and was ready with a barrage of questions.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> told the king that his father was in the best of spirits and had been provided with all the comforts except one.

<br><br>

The king wanted to know what was lacking because now he thought he had found a way to send things and people to <b>heaven</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> answered that there were <b>no barbers in heaven</b>, which is why even he was forced to grow his own beard. He said that his father had asked for a <b>good barber</b>.

<br><br>

So, the king decided to send his own barber to serve his father in <b>heaven</b>.

<br><br>

He called both the <b>barber</b> and the <b>magician</b> to prepare to send him to <b>heaven</b>. The barber could say absolutely nothing in his own defense as he was caught in his own trap.

<br><br>

And once the <b>pyre</b> was lit, he died on the spot.

<br><br>

Nobody dared to conspire against <b>Birbal</b> again.

<item><![CDATA[Once a <b>rich merchant’s house</b> was robbed. The merchant suspected that the thief was one of his <b>servants</b>. So he went to <b>Birbal</b> and mentioned the incident.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> went to his house, assembled all of his <b>servants</b>, and asked who had stolen the merchant’s things. Everybody <b>denied</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> thought for a moment, then gave a <b>stick of equal length</b> to all the servants of the merchant and said to them, <b>"The stick of the real thief will be longer by two inches tomorrow. All of you must be present here again with your sticks."</b>

<br><br>

All the servants went to their homes and gathered again at the same place the next day.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> asked them to show their sticks. One of the servants had his <b>stick shorter by two inches</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> immediately pointed at him and said, <b>"This is your thief, merchant."</b>

<br><br>

Later, the merchant asked <b>Birbal</b>, <b>"How did you catch him?"</b>

<br><br>

<b>Birbal</b> smiled and said, <b>"The thief had already cut his stick short by two inches in the night, fearing that his stick would be longer by two inches by morning."</b>

<b>Birbal’s Clever Punishment</b>

<br><br>

<b>Mahesh Das</b> was a citizen in the kingdom of <b>Akbar</b>. He was an <b>intelligent</b> young man.

<br><br>

Once, when <b>Akbar</b> went <b>hunting</b> in the jungle, he <b>lost his way</b>. <b>Mahesh Das</b>, who lived on the outskirts, helped the king reach the palace. The emperor <b>rewarded</b> him with his <b>ring</b>.

<br><br>

The Emperor also <b>promised</b> to give him a responsible <b>position</b> at his court. After a few days, <b>Mahesh Das</b> went to the court. The <b>guard</b> did not allow him to enter.

<br><br>

<b>Mahesh Das</b> showed the guard the <b>ring</b> which the king had given him. Now, the <b>greedy</b> guard thought that the young man was sure to get <b>more rewards</b> from the king. The guard agreed to allow him inside on <b>one condition</b>: <b>Mahesh Das</b> had to <b>pay him half</b> of the reward he would get from the Emperor. <b>Mahesh Das</b> <b>accepted</b> the condition.

<br><br>

He then entered the court and <b>showed the ring</b> to the King.

<br><br>

The King, who recognized <b>Mahesh Das</b>, asked him, <b>"Oh young man! What do you expect as a reward from the King of Hindustan?"</b>

<br><br>

<b>"Majesty! I expect 50 lashes from you as a reward,"</b> replied <b>Mahesh Das</b>.

<br><br>

The courtiers were <b>stunned</b>. They thought that he was <b>mad</b>. <b>Akbar</b> pondered over his request and asked him the <b>reason</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Mahesh Das</b> said he would tell him the reason <b>after receiving his reward</b>. Then the king’s men <b>whipped</b> him as per his wish.

<br><br>

After the <b>25th lash</b>, <b>Mahesh Das</b> requested the King to <b>call the guard</b> who was at the gate.

<br><br>

The guard appeared before the King, <b>happy</b> at the thought that he was called to be <b>rewarded</b>. But to his <b>surprise</b>, <b>Mahesh Das</b> told the King, <b>"Jahapana! This greedy guard let me inside on the condition that I pay him half the reward I receive from you. I wanted to teach him a lesson. Please give the remaining 25 lashes to this guard so that I can keep my promise to him."</b>

<br><br>

The King then <b>ordered</b> that the guard be given <b>25 lashes</b> along with <b>5 years of imprisonment</b>.

<br><br>

The King was very <b>happy</b> with <b>Mahesh Das</b>. He called him closer and said, <b>"You are not only intelligent but also just. You have exposed the corrupt nature of my guard in the most brilliant way."</b>

<br><br>

Akbar then asked him, <b>"Tell me, young man, what is your name?"</b>

<br><br>

With a humble bow, the young man replied, <b>"Your Majesty, my name is Mahesh Das."</b>

<br><br>

Akbar smiled and said, <b>"From this day forward, you shall no longer be just Mahesh Das. I name you \'Birbal,\' and you shall serve as one of my most trusted ministers."</b>

<br><br>

The entire court erupted in applause. Thus, <b>Mahesh Das became Birbal</b>, the wisest and most beloved minister in Akbar’s court. From that day onward, Birbal continued to use his wit and intelligence to help the Emperor and his people, proving time and again that <b>wisdom is the greatest wealth a man can have</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Moral: Intelligence and honesty will always be rewarded.</b>

<item><![CDATA[Once, somebody in the palace of the Emperor had a wound. The royal <b>Vaidya</b> (physician) was called, and he suggested that if camel’s milk was applied to the wound, it would heal quickly. The Emperor announced in his court that he needed camel’s milk. Everybody was surprised to hear this but did not dare to say anything.

<br><br>
A couple of days passed, but nobody could find camel’s milk. So, <b>Birbal</b> was assigned this task. Birbal tried his best to explain to the Emperor that there was no such thing as camel’s milk, but the Emperor insisted, “When the royal Vaidya has prescribed it, it must exist. Bring it from anywhere.”

<br><br>
Birbal was very upset. He went home and thought about how to make the Emperor realize that camel’s milk does not exist. A few days passed, and Birbal did not attend court. Akbar grew worried and sent a servant to Birbal’s house to check on him.

<br><br>
When the servant arrived, he saw Birbal’s daughter washing clothes outside the house. She greeted the servant. The servant asked, “What happened? Why has Birbal not come to court?”
The daughter replied, “Last night, my father gave birth to a child.”

<br><br>
The servant was shocked by this absurd statement but returned to the Emperor and reported it. The Emperor was also bewildered and decided to visit Birbal’s house to find out the truth himself.

<br><br>
Upon seeing the Emperor, Birbal greeted him respectfully. The Emperor asked, “Birbal, what is this nonsense? Can a man give birth to a child?”

<br><br>
Birbal politely replied, “Huzoor, if a camel can have milk, why can’t a man give birth to a child?”

<br><br>
The Emperor immediately realized his mistake. He smiled at Birbal’s cleverness and canceled his order.

<br><br>

<item><![CDATA[
On a cold winter day, <b>Akbar</b> and <b>Birbal</b> took a walk along the lake. A thought came to Birbal that a man would do anything for money. He expressed his feelings to Akbar.

<br><br>
Akbar then dipped his finger into the lake and immediately pulled it out, shivering from the cold. He said, “I don’t think a man would spend an entire night in the cold water of this lake for money.”

<br><br>
Birbal replied, “I am sure I can find such a person.”

<br><br>
Akbar challenged Birbal to find someone willing to take on the challenge, promising a reward of a <b>thousand gold coins</b> to the person who could do it.

<br><br>
Birbal searched far and wide until he found a poor man desperate enough to accept the challenge. That night, the man entered the lake, and Akbar posted guards nearby to ensure that he remained in the cold water.

<br><br>
The next morning, the guards took the poor man to Akbar. The Emperor asked, “Did you truly spend the entire night in the lake?”

<br><br>
The poor man humbly replied, “Yes, Your Majesty.”

<br><br>
Akbar then asked how he managed to endure the freezing night.

<br><br>
The poor man said, “There was a street lamp at a distance, and I kept my focus on it to distract myself from the cold.”

<br><br>
Hearing this, Akbar declared, “Then you will not receive the reward! You did not survive the night by your will alone but by the warmth of the street lamp.”

<br><br>
The poor man was heartbroken and went to Birbal for help.

<br><br>
The next day, Birbal did not attend the court. Curious and concerned, the Emperor sent a messenger to check on him. The messenger returned and said, “Birbal will come once his <b>Khichdi</b> (rice dish) is cooked.”

<br><br>
Hours passed, and Birbal still did not arrive. Growing impatient, Akbar decided to visit Birbal’s house himself.

<br><br>
Upon arrival, he found Birbal sitting near some burning twigs with a bowl of <b>Khichdi</b> hanging five feet above the fire.

<br><br>
Akbar and his attendants could not help but laugh.

<br><br>
Akbar said, “How can the Khichdi cook if it is so far from the fire?”

<br><br>
Birbal smiled and replied, “The same way the poor man received warmth from a street lamp that was more than a furlong away.”

<br><br>
Akbar realized his mistake and understood Birbal’s wisdom. He immediately ordered the poor man to be given his well-deserved reward.

<br><br>
<b>Moral:</b> A small ray of hope is enough to inspire those who are ready to work hard to turn their dreams into reality.

<item><![CDATA[
<b>Sri Krishna Devaraya</b> was the emperor of <b>Vijayanagara</b>. He had eight advisors, and <b>Tenali Rama</b> was one of them. Tenali Rama was very clever and spontaneous.

<br><br>
The emperor had a special kind of <b>brinjal</b> plant in his royal garden. These brinjals were extremely rare, and the curry made from them was loved by the emperor. As they were of a rare kind, the garden was heavily guarded, and no one was allowed to view the plants without the emperor’s permission.

<br><br>
One day, the emperor arranged a grand dinner for his advisors, where the brinjal curry was served. <b>Tenali Rama</b> enjoyed the brinjal curry so much that he couldn\'t forget its taste even after returning home.

<br><br>
He told his wife about the delicious curry. His wife, eager to taste it herself, asked Tenali Rama to bring some brinjals so that she could prepare the curry at home. However, Tenali Rama knew how much the emperor valued his rare brinjals. He was also aware that the emperor kept a strict count of them, and if even a single brinjal went missing, the culprit would face severe punishment.

<br><br>
Despite knowing the risk, Tenali Rama’s wife pleaded with him to bring a few brinjals from the royal garden. Finally, Tenali Rama had no choice but to fulfill her wish.

<br><br>
That night, Tenali Rama sneaked into the emperor’s garden, jumped over the wall, and carefully plucked a few brinjals. Fortunately, no one saw him.

<br><br>
The next day, his wife prepared the brinjal curry, and it turned out to be just as delicious as the one served at the royal dinner. She was delighted. However, like any loving mother, she wanted to share the tasty dish with their son.

<br><br>
Tenali Rama, fearing that their son might unknowingly reveal the truth, warned his wife against feeding him the curry. But his wife refused to listen. She couldn\'t eat the curry without sharing it with their little child, who was sleeping after finishing his homework on the rooftop.

<br><br>
Tenali Rama had to come up with a plan. He hesitated but finally thought of a clever idea. He went up to the rooftop with a bucket of water and poured it on his sleeping son. The child woke up startled. Tenali Rama said, <b>“It’s raining! Let’s go inside and have dinner.”</b>

<br><br>
The boy, believing it had rained, changed his clothes and enjoyed the tasty brinjal curry. Before putting him back to bed, Tenali Rama told his wife loudly, <b>“Since it is raining outside, let the boy sleep in the room.”</b>

<br><br>
The next morning, the emperor discovered that a few brinjals were missing from his garden. The royal gardener, who kept an exact count of every vegetable and flower, reported that <b>three brinjals</b> were missing. This became a serious issue, and the emperor ordered a thorough investigation.

<br><br>
The emperor declared a <b>reward</b> for the person who could catch the thief.

<br><br>
The chief advisor, <b>Appaji</b>, suspected that only Tenali Rama was capable of such mischief. He informed the emperor of his suspicion. As a result, the emperor sent his guards to summon Tenali Rama.

<br><br>
When Tenali Rama arrived at the court, the emperor questioned him about the missing brinjals. Tenali Rama innocently replied, <b>“I have no idea about the missing brinjals, Your Majesty.”</b>

<br><br>
The chief advisor suggested interrogating Tenali Rama’s son. The emperor agreed and ordered his courtiers to bring the boy to the court.

<br><br>
Upon arrival, the little boy was asked, <b>“What did you have for dinner last night?”</b>

<br><br>
The child innocently replied, <b>“Brinjal curry! And it was very tasty.”</b>

<br><br>
Hearing this, the chief advisor turned to Tenali Rama and said, <b>“Now you must confess your crime!”</b>

<br><br>
However, Tenali Rama remained calm and said, <b>“My son must be speaking about something he saw in his dreams. He went to bed early last night.”</b>

<br><br>
To confirm, the emperor himself questioned the boy, <b>“Tell me clearly, what did you do yesterday after coming from school?”</b>

<br><br>
The child replied, <b>“After school, I played for some time. Then, I went to the rooftop, did my homework, and fell asleep. Later, when it started raining, my father woke me up. My clothes were completely wet, so we went inside, changed, had dinner, and then I went back to sleep.”</b>

<br><br>
Everyone in the court was shocked! <b>There had been no rain at all the previous night!</b> The atmosphere had been completely dry.

<br><br>
Realizing that the boy had simply described a dream, the emperor and his advisors believed that Tenali Rama was innocent. He was freed without any punishment.

<br><br>
However, later, Tenali Rama confessed the truth to the emperor. The emperor, impressed by Tenali Rama’s clever thinking and wit, laughed heartily and pardoned him.

<br><br>
<b>Moral:</b> Stealing is never a good thing! However, using intelligence and wit can help one get out of difficult situations.

<b>The Witty Tenali Raman Outsmarts the Thieves</b>

<br><br>
The witty <b>Tenali Raman</b> was well known as <b>King Krishna Deva Raya</b>\'s favorite courtier. He had also become quite wealthy, as he frequently received valuable gifts from the king. This made Tenali Raman an easy target for thieves.

<br><br>
One hot summer night, while <b>Tenali Raman</b> and his wife were relaxing in their courtyard, his sharp eyes caught some movement among the leaves in his garden. There was not even a faint breeze, so he immediately suspected the presence of intruders. He was right—two thieves were hiding there.

<br><br>
Thinking quickly, <b>Raman</b> decided to teach them a lesson. Speaking loudly enough for the thieves to hear, he said to his wife, <b>“My dear, I have heard that far too many robberies are taking place in our neighborhood. To be safe, let us hide all our jewels in the well.”</b>

<br><br>
A little while later, <b>Raman</b> and his wife came out, struggling to carry a heavy trunk. They walked to the well and dropped it inside. The trunk fell with a mighty splash. Then, they calmly returned to their house as if they were going to sleep.

<br><br>
The thieves, convinced that the trunk contained jewels, waited for some time before sneaking toward the well. They quietly began drawing water, hoping to empty the well and retrieve the treasure.

<br><br>
The entire night, the two thieves toiled away, pulling out bucket after bucket of water and pouring it out as quietly as they could. They were completely exhausted but determined to get their hands on the supposed treasure. Finally, after hours of effort, they managed to pull out the trunk.

<br><br>
To their utter dismay, when they opened it, they found nothing but <b>huge stones</b> inside!

<br><br>
By morning, the thieves were completely drained of energy and miserable, realizing that they had been <b>outsmarted by the witty Raman</b>.

<br><br>
Just then, <b>Tenali Raman</b> stepped out of his house, looked at them, and said with a mischievous smile, <b>“Thank you for watering my garden. You have saved me a lot of trouble!”</b>

<br><br>
Realizing they had been tricked, the two thieves fell at <b>Tenali Raman</b>’s feet, begging for forgiveness. Without saying another word, they hobbled away as fast as they could, vowing never to cross paths with the clever courtier again.

<b>Tenali Raman and the Greedy Guards</b>

<br><br>
<b>Tenali Raman</b> arrived in <b>Hampi</b>, the capital of the <b>Vijayanagara Empire</b>, which was ruled at the time by <b>Krishna Deva Raya</b>.

<br><br>
Raman turned to his wife and said, <b>“Wait for me here in the temple. I will go to the palace and meet the king. He is a generous man, and he may give me some gifts.”</b>

<br><br>
When <b>Raman</b> reached the palace, he was stopped at the entrance.

<br><br>
<b>“You cannot enter the palace without permission,”</b> said the guard.

<br><br>
<b>“I have come from a far-off place. Please allow me to enter the palace,”</b> pleaded Raman. <b>“I am hoping that the generous king will bestow some gifts upon me.”</b>

<br><br>
The greedy guard smirked and said, <b>“You may get gifts from the king, but what do I get?”</b>

<br><br>
Understanding the guard’s hint, <b>Raman</b> replied, <b>“Whatever the king gives me, I will share it with you.”</b>

<br><br>
<b>“Half of it. Whatever gifts the king gives you, you must give me half,”</b> demanded the guard.

<br><br>
Raman agreed and was allowed inside. However, upon reaching the grand hall where the <b>king’s durbar</b> was being held, he was stopped again by another guard.

<br><br>
This guard also demanded a share of Raman’s gifts. Raman, without hesitation, promised to give him <b>half of the gifts</b> as well.

<br><br>
Finally, <b>Raman</b> entered the court. However, the king was not in a good mood. Overjoyed to be in the king’s presence, Raman hurried forward without waiting for permission.

<br><br>
Annoyed by this breach of protocol, <b>Krishna Deva Raya</b> thundered, <b>“Give him fifty lashes!”</b>

<br><br>
Raman calmly folded his hands in salutation and said, <b>“I am grateful to Your Majesty for this generous gift. However, please allow me to share my gifts with two of my dear friends.”</b>

<br><br>
The king, curious, asked, <b>“Who are these friends?”</b>

<br><br>
<b>“The two guards—the one at the palace entrance and the one at the hall entrance. They were eager to share in whatever gifts I received from you,”</b> Raman replied.

<br><br>
The king immediately summoned both guards. Upon hearing Raman’s words, he became furious.

<br><br>
<b>“Now that I know you two wanted a share of the ‘gift,’ I will increase it to one hundred lashes!”</b> the king declared.

<br><br>
The guards were taken away and each received fifty lashes.

<br><br>
Meanwhile, the king turned back to <b>Raman</b> and said sternly, <b>“You have tempted my honest guards with bribes. I give severe punishment to those who offer bribes.”</b>

<br><br>
Then, he turned to the exhausted guards, who had just returned after their punishment.

<br><br>
<b>“Take him to the riverside and cut off his head with a single stroke of your swords,”</b> the king ordered.

As the guards led <b>Tenali Raman</b> to the riverfront, he remained calm and composed. The two guards, still furious about the lashes they had received, were eager to carry out the execution.

<br><br>
When they reached the riverbank, one of the guards raised his sword and sneered, <b>“Any last words before we carry out the king’s orders?”</b>

<br><br>
<b>Tenali Raman</b> smiled and said, <b>“Of course! I only request that you follow the king’s command exactly as he gave it.”</b>

<br><br>
The guards paused. <b>“What do you mean?”</b> one of them asked.

<br><br>
<b>“His Majesty ordered you to cut off my head with a single stroke of your sword. But tell me, have you ever done such a thing before? Are you skilled enough to do it in one stroke?”</b>

<br><br>
The guards exchanged nervous glances. It was true—they were not executioners. If they failed to sever his head in one clean stroke, the king might punish them severely.

<br><br>
<b>Tenali Raman</b> continued, <b>“Imagine if you fail, and I survive! The king will be very angry with you for disobeying his direct order. And if you try again, and fail again, your fate might be worse than mine!”</b>

<br><br>
The guards, now filled with doubt and fear, hesitated.

<br><br>
<b>“What do we do now?”</b> whispered one guard to the other.

<br><br>
<b>“Perhaps we should go back to the king and confirm his orders,”</b> the other replied.

<br><br>
The guards, now afraid for their own lives, decided to take <b>Tenali Raman</b> back to the palace instead of executing him.

<br><br>
When they arrived at the court, the king was surprised to see <b>Tenali Raman</b> still alive.

<br><br>
<b>“Why have you not carried out my orders?”</b> he demanded.

<br><br>
The trembling guards explained everything.

<br><br>
<b>Krishna Deva Raya</b> burst into laughter. He was impressed by <b>Tenali Raman’s</b> intelligence and presence of mind.

<br><br>
<b>“You are truly the cleverest man in my kingdom!”</b> he exclaimed.

<br><br>
The king forgave <b>Tenali Raman</b> and instead of punishing him, rewarded him with gold coins for his wit. However, he also dismissed the two greedy guards from their positions for their dishonesty.

<br><br>
<b>Moral:</b> Quick thinking and intelligence can save a person even in the most dangerous situations. Honesty and integrity are more valuable than greed.

<br><br>
Hearing this, the two guards were overjoyed. At last, they could take their revenge on <b>Raman</b>! They immediately grabbed him and led him toward the riverfront, eager to carry out the execution.

The robbers gathered that night near Raman’s house, eagerly planning to retrieve the box of riches from the well. They waited until the household was asleep before sneaking into the courtyard.

<br><br>
One by one, the thieves quietly approached the well. Using buckets and ropes, they began drawing water, hoping to empty the well and retrieve the treasure. Hours passed, and the robbers tirelessly pulled up bucket after bucket, pouring the water out onto the ground.

<br><br>
Meanwhile, Raman, who had been secretly watching everything from his window, chuckled to himself. His plan was working perfectly.

<br><br>
By dawn, the robbers were exhausted, their muscles aching from the endless work. Finally, they managed to pull out the heavy wooden box. Excitedly, they broke open the lock, only to find it filled with nothing but stones!

<br><br>
Just then, a loud voice rang out.

<br><br>
<b>“Well done! You have saved me the trouble of emptying my well for cleaning!”</b>

<br><br>
The robbers turned to see Raman standing with the kotwal and his soldiers. Before they could react, the soldiers surrounded them.

<br><br>
Realizing they had been outwitted, the robbers hung their heads in shame. The kotwal ordered his men to arrest them at once.

<br><br>
King Krishnadeva Raya was pleased with Raman’s intelligence and rewarded him for his clever trick.

<br><br>
<b>Moral:</b> Intelligence and wit are more powerful than physical strength. A sharp mind can outsmart even the most cunning opponents.

Tenali Raman was not one to accept defeat so easily. Though banished from the king’s presence, he knew that he would one day regain the king’s favor with his wit and intelligence.

<br><br>

A few weeks later, the kingdom was abuzz with excitement. A famous <b>sculptor</b> had arrived from a distant land and was creating a grand <b>statue</b> of King <b>Krishnadeva Raya</b>. The statue was to be unveiled in the royal court in front of all the ministers and courtiers.

<br><br>

Raman saw this as the perfect opportunity. He disguised himself as an old <b>sculptor’s assistant</b> and approached the master sculptor, offering his help. The sculptor, impressed by his knowledge of <b>stonework</b>, allowed him to assist in the final touches of the statue.

<br><br>

On the day of the grand unveiling, the entire court gathered to see the magnificent statue. When the cloth covering it was removed, everyone gasped in astonishment. The statue was flawless—except for one peculiar detail. Instead of the <b>king’s face</b>, the statue had a <b>veil</b> over it, hiding its features completely.

<br><br>

The <b>king</b> was furious. "What is the meaning of this?" he demanded.

<br><br>

The <b>sculptor</b>, confused, turned to his assistant—who removed his disguise to reveal himself as none other than <b>Tenali Raman</b>.

<br><br>

With a deep bow, Raman said, "Your Majesty, I did not want to disobey your orders. You had asked me never to show you my <b>face</b>. So, I found another way to return to your court without breaking your command!"

<br><br>

The entire court erupted into <b>laughter</b>. Even <b>King Krishnadeva Raya</b> could not help but smile at Raman’s cleverness.

<br><br>

"Raman, you are truly one of a kind!" the <b>king</b> said. "I take back my command. I cannot afford to lose someone as <b>intelligent</b> as you."

<br><br>

From that day on, <b>Tenali Raman</b> once again became the <b>king’s most trusted advisor</b>, proving that <b>intelligence</b> and <b>wit</b> can overcome any obstacle.

<br><br>

<b>Moral:</b> Clever thinking and determination can turn even the most difficult situations into opportunities for success.

Tenali Raman and his wife were on their way to <b>Hampi</b>, the capital of <b>Vijayanagara</b>. On the way, they passed through a village at the foot of a hill. The villagers had gathered in front of the village <b>temple</b>. Raman’s wife became curious and dragged her husband to the spot. The husband and wife pushed through the crowd to appear in the front row.

<br><br>

A <b>bodybuilder</b> was exhibiting his strength. He was seen carrying a huge <b>gunny bag</b> on his left shoulder and twirling his mustache with his right hand.

<br><br>

"He is carrying a bag of <b>500 quintals</b> of rice," said the man standing next to Raman.

<br><br>

"This is nothing. I can carry a <b>thousand times</b> more weight," said Raman in a loud voice.

<br><br>

Startled by this announcement, the bodybuilder dropped the bag he was carrying. Everybody looked at Raman, wondering whether a new champion had arrived.

<br><br>

Enjoying the attention, Raman addressed the crowd. "Why, I can carry that <b>hill</b> on my bare shoulder," he said, pointing out the hill nearby.

<br><br>

The villagers gaped at him. Raman’s wife appeared <b>tense</b>. She had a suspicion that her husband had opened his mouth too wide.

<br><br>

Meanwhile, the <b>bodybuilder</b> had recovered his wit. He laughed out loud and said, "Is that so? Let’s see you do it."

<br><br>

The villagers were now <b>excited</b>. They had seen only <b>Hanumanji</b> carrying the <b>Sanjeevani mountain</b>—and that too in pictures. Now here was a man who claimed he could repeat the feat.

<br><br>

"I said I can do it. Did I say I’ll do it now?" asked Raman. "<b>Carrying a hill</b> requires a lot of <b>preparation</b>," Raman added.

<br><br>

Turning to the weight lifter, Raman asked, "How long did you take to prepare for this feat of carrying the sack of rice?"

<br><br>

"<b>Three months</b>," confessed the weight lifter.

<br><br>

"How long will you take?" the <b>Village Chief</b> asked Raman.

<br><br>

"<b>Six months</b>," said Raman without batting an eye.

<br><br>

Then Raman added, "I need to eat an enormous amount of food to build my muscles. And I need someone to <b>massage my body</b> daily."

<br><br>

"And we need a place to live. We are <b>outsiders</b>," said Raman’s wife.

<br><br>

The <b>village chief</b> agreed to provide the couple with a <b>house</b> and arrange the <b>food supply</b>. He directed the weight lifter to give Raman a <b>body massage</b> daily.

<br><br>

"And we will meet here, exactly <b>six months</b> from now," said the village chief, getting up from the chair.

<br><br>

Raman’s wife was <b>relieved</b>. They did not have to wonder where the food would come from—for the next six months, at least.

<br><br>

Raman led a <b>royal life</b> in the village. Villagers supplied <b>pots of milk, honey, and curd</b>. <b>Cartloads</b> of rice and ragi were delivered to their house. The bodybuilder was available to <b>cook food</b> and also give a <b>body massage</b> to Raman every day.

<br><br>

The bodybuilder, who had become a <b>Raman disciple</b> by now, asked Raman about the practice. "Would you like to begin with a <b>small rock</b>, then move on to <b>bigger</b> and <b>bigger rocks</b>?" he asked. Raman sent him away, asking him to make <b>ragi mudde</b> (balls of steamed ragi flour).

<br><br>

Soon, it was the <b>D-day</b>. The whole village assembled at the foot of the hill. Raman and his wife arrived in a <b>decorated cart</b> pulled by the bodybuilder. The villagers <b>cheered</b> as Raman stepped forward.

<br><br>

The <b>village chief</b> gave a sign that the show could begin.

<br><br>

Raman stood in a <b>circle</b> with people seated all around. He sat in the warrior’s pose, <b>Veeramudra</b>, and announced he was ready.

<br><br>

The villagers were <b>puzzled</b>. The <b>village chief</b> became impatient. "What are you waiting for?" he barked.

<br><br>

"I’m waiting for your men to <b>place the hill</b> on my shoulder," said Raman calmly.

<br><br>

Everybody <b>gaped</b> at Raman.

<br><br>

The <b>village chief</b> shouted in anger, "You said … "

<br><br>

Raman cut him short, "I said I will <b>carry</b> that hill. Even now, I’m willing to <b>carry</b> the hill. I’m waiting for your men to <b>place it</b> on my shoulder."

<br><br>

"But <b>who</b> will lift the hill?" asked the Village Chief in <b>bewilderment</b>.

<br><br>

"That’s <b>your problem</b>," Raman said.

<br><br>

"Only <b>Hanumanji</b> can lift it," said Raman’s wife.

<br><br>

The <b>village chief</b> joined his hands in <b>salutation</b> to Raman. "A man of your <b>strength and determination</b> should carry not a lowly hill, but <b>Mount Kailas</b>."

<br><br>

The <b>villagers</b> started laughing.

<br><br>

When they got back home, Raman asked his wife to <b>pack</b>. "We are <b>leaving</b> this village," he said.

The intelligence of <b>animals</b> was being discussed in the court of <b>King Krishnadevaraya</b>.

<br><br>

"<b>Cats</b> are most intelligent," said one minister. Others in the court agreed with the minister. They started describing how <b>clever</b> their own cats were. Each one claimed his own cat was the <b>smartest</b>.

<br><br>

The king wanted to hold a <b>competition</b> for cats.

<br><br>

"The cat that does something which no other cat can do will be declared the <b>winner</b>," announced the king.

<br><br>

The following week, the <b>courtiers</b> came with their cats. <b>Raman of Tenali</b> also brought his cat to the court.

<br><br>

The king wanted to give a <b>treat</b> to the cats first. <b>Milk</b> was served to the cats in <b>golden plates</b>.

<br><br>

The moment they saw the <b>milk</b>, all cats <b>rushed</b> towards it. Only one cat ran in the <b>opposite direction</b>—away from the milk.

<br><br>

The king was <b>surprised</b> to see this <b>strange behavior</b>.

<br><br>

Raman said with a smile, "<b>Maharaj</b>, all cats ran towards milk. <b>My cat ran away</b> from milk. My cat has done what no other cat has done."

<br><br>

<b>Krishnadevaraya</b> agreed and declared <b>Raman’s cat</b> as the <b>winner</b>.

<br><br>

When Raman came to collect the <b>prize</b>, the king asked him how he trained his cat to do what no other cat could do.

<br><br>

Raman smiled.

<br><br>

"I wanted to make sure that my cat gets the <b>best milk</b>. So, I <b>boiled</b> the milk and poured it in a plate to <b>cool</b> it. The moment he saw milk, my cat came <b>running</b> to lap it up. Before I could stop him, he had the <b>first lick</b> and <b>burnt his tongue</b>.

<br><br>

Since that day, whenever he sees <b>milk in a plate</b>, he runs away."

<br><br>

The king and Raman had a <b>hearty laugh</b>.

An <b>Arab</b> brought a shipload of <b>horses</b> from <b>Persia</b>. Many in the court of <b>King Krishnadevaraya</b> bought the horses from the Arab.

<br><br>

<b>Raman</b> maintained that <b>Vijayanagara’s horses</b> were <b>superior</b> to the horses from <b>Arabia</b>. The ministers who bought the <b>Arabian horses</b> challenged Raman to prove this point in a <b>horse race</b>.

<br><br>

The courtiers put in much effort to <b>train</b> their horses. They fed the horses well to make sure they were <b>strong</b> and <b>sturdy</b>.

<br><br>

On the day of the <b>race</b>, all the courtiers brought their <b>well-fed horses</b> to a field. They had employed <b>well-trained jockeys</b> to ride the horses.

<br><br>

<b>Raman</b> brought his horse, which looked <b>lean</b> and <b>thin</b>. He had a <b>hungry look</b>, as though he had not eaten for days. Raman announced that he himself would <b>ride his horse</b>.

<br><br>

Raman sat on the <b>hungry-looking horse</b>. He had a <b>long pole</b> in his hand. He had tied a <b>bundle of grass</b> to one end of the stick.

<br><br>

All the horses were lined up with the <b>jockeys</b> in position. <b>Raman</b> sat on the <b>hungry-looking horse</b>. He had a <b>long pole</b> in his hand. He had tied a <b>bundle of grass</b> to one end of the stick. Holding the stick from the other end, Raman <b>dangled</b> the grass in front of the horse.

<br><br>

The horse wanted to <b>grab the food</b>. So, he <b>ran fast</b>. But no matter how <b>fast</b> he ran, the grass remained <b>outside his reach</b>.

<br><br>

The horse kept running with <b>greater speed</b> until it <b>crossed the finish line</b>, coming <b>first</b> in the race.

<br><br>

<b>Raman</b> hugged his horse and fed it <b>lush green grass</b>.

<br><br>

When Raman went to collect the <b>prize</b>, the king asked him the <b>secret of his success</b>.

<br><br>

"One must have a <b>hunger for success</b>, <b>Maharaj</b>," Raman said, "only then will one <b>succeed</b>."

<b>Tenali Raman</b> went to <b>Krishna Deva Raya</b>, the king of <b>Vijayanagar</b>, hoping to receive some <b>gifts</b>. The gift he got was a <b>hundred lashes</b> for approaching the king without an appointment!

<br><br>

<b>Raman</b> passed on the ‘gift’ to the two <b>guards</b> who had demanded half of the ‘gift’ he was going to collect. Of course, the two guards did not know that Raman would be rewarded <b>fifty lashes</b>!

<br><br>

The king, however, wanted to <b>punish</b> Raman for bribing the guards. He ordered the guards to take <b>Raman</b> to the <b>riverfront</b> and <b>cut off his head</b> with a single stroke from their swords.

<br><br>

The guards who had received <b>50 lashes</b> each had a score to settle with <b>Raman</b>. They were only too happy to be his <b>executors</b>.

<br><br>

They took him to the <b>riverfront</b> and <b>tied him to a tree</b>. Then they started <b>sharpening their swords</b>. An argument arose on who would execute Raman.

<br><br>

Raman pointed out the king’s order was that he should be executed by <b>both the guards</b>. The guards agreed, <b>untied</b> Raman and <b>dragged</b> him to the river.

<br><br>

Standing on either side of Raman in the <b>knee-deep water</b>, the guards asked Raman to <b>get ready</b> to be executed.

<br><br>

Raman said, "You do your duty. But I have one request. My only desire is to <b>die with the name of Kaali Ma on my lips</b>."

<br><br>

"All right," said the guards, "You pray. We’ll wait."

<br><br>

"You be ready with your <b>swords drawn</b>. Strike the moment I cry out, <b>’Jai Kaali Ma’</b>," requested Raman.

<br><br>

The guards agreed. Raman stood in the water, <b>eyes closed</b>. The guards stood on either side of Raman, their <b>swords drawn</b>, ready to strike the moment they heard the cry, <b>‘Jai Kaali Ma.’</b>

<br><br>

Raman <b>prayed silently</b> with eyes closed for a minute. Then he shouted, <b>‘Jai Kaali Ma’</b>, and <b>ducked under the water</b>, even as the guards struck.

<br><br>

There was a <b>clash of swords</b>, and Raman was <b>nowhere to be seen</b>.

<br><br>

The guards were <b>astonished</b>. As they looked for him, Raman <b>raised his head above the water</b>.

<br><br>

The guards were <b>relieved</b> to find Raman, and at the same time, <b>annoyed</b> with him.

<br><br>

"You cannot fool us this time. Get ready to die. Now."

<br><br>

Raman raised an <b>objection</b>. "The king’s order was to <b>cut off my head with one stroke</b> which you have <b>already used</b>. For a <b>second strike</b>, you need the king’s <b>permission</b>."

<br><br>

So, the guards led him <b>back to the palace</b> to await instructions from their king.

<br><br>

<b>Raman</b> was <b>saved</b> for now.

<br><br>

<b>Mowgli</b> and his friends in <b>The Jungle Book</b>. Mowgli, as an infant, had been found by the <b>wolf</b> in the jungle. She had brought him up just as she had brought up her own cubs.

<br><br>

Mowgli, still a boy, played with all the animals in the jungle. He had many friends; <b>Bhaloo, the bear</b>, <b>Bagheera, the panther</b>, and his many <b>monkey friends</b>. But <b>Sher Khan, the tiger</b>, was cruel. Mowgli had always been warned to stay away from <b>Sher Khan’s territory</b>. Sher Khan did not like Mowgli and waited for a chance to harm the boy.

<br><br>

One day, while Mowgli was playing, <b>Bhaloo</b> came running to Mowgli and said, <b>"Mowgli, Sher Khan is in a terrible temper. He is going around telling everyone that he wants to kill you."</b>

<br><br>

Mowgli said, <b>"Don’t worry Bhaloo, I can protect myself."</b>

<br><br>

Mowgli had a plan. It was to <b>counter-attack</b>. He wanted to let loose the <b>wild bulls</b> of the forest on Sher Khan. To do this, he had to corner Sher Khan.

<br><br>

He knew where Sher Khan spent most of his time; it was on a <b>slope in the mountains</b>, far from Mowgli’s cave. He did not want <b>Sher Khan</b> to spot him because that would be the <b>end of him</b>.

<br><br>

Mowgli thought, <b>"I should go around the mountain and to the top without Sher Khan seeing me. From the top, the bulls can charge at Sher Khan."</b>

<br><br>

That evening, Mowgli gathered <b>eight wild bulls</b> with the <b>longest and sharpest thorns</b>. He said, <b>"Today, we will put an end to the reign of terror by Sher Khan. This is my plan."</b>

<br><br>

Mowgli explained to the bulls how he wanted to attack <b>Sher Khan</b>.

<br><br>

As per the plan, they circled the mountain, unnoticed by the <b>slumbering tiger</b>. Once they reached the top, they could see, in a clearing a little below, <b>Sher Khan</b> resting.

<br><br>

Mowgli said, <b>"Once I give you the signal, charge together. Any false move and we could be endangering our lives."</b>

<br><br>

Mowgli lifted up his hands, brought them down, and shouted, <b>"CHARGE!"</b>

<br><br>

The bulls ran down the slope, kicking up huge amounts of dust.

<br><br>

<b>Sher Khan</b> looked up, hearing this thunderous noise. He saw the <b>bulls hurtling towards him</b>. He tried to <b>turn and run</b>, but before he knew it, the <b>bulls were on top of him</b>.

<br><br>

The bulls <b>pierced Sher Khan with their horns</b> and <b>flung him</b> with the momentum of their run. <b>Sher Khan</b> was <b>hurled and flung to his death</b>.

<br><br>

Mowgli and the bulls <b>proudly</b> went to announce to the jungle folks of <b>Sher Khan’s end</b>.

One stormy night at sea, a ship was wrecked. All the passengers on board drowned, except <b>Lemuel Gulliver</b>.

<br><br>

Gulliver was an excellent swimmer and swam for many miles before he reached the shore. Gulliver was very tired and decided to sleep. He would look for food after he had had sufficient rest.

<br><br>

<b>Gulliver in the Land of Lilliput</b>

<br><br>

Gulliver slept for a whole day. When he woke up, the <b>Sun</b> was beating down upon him. He tried to move, but he could not. His hair, hands, legs, and body were <b>tied to the ground</b>.

<br><br>

He saw <b>little men</b> running all around him. Someone had got a <b>tiny ladder</b> and was climbing up to him. The little man, no bigger than <b>Gulliver’s thumbnail</b>, came up to his ears and said,

<b>"You are in the land of Lilliput; we are Lilliputians. We are taking you to our Emperor, so please do not make any trouble. You will be shot at."</b>

<br><br>

Gulliver almost laughed at this threat but nodded.

<br><br>

A <b>huge wooden structure with wheels</b> was brought. Gulliver was slid onto it after much struggle. The wooden structure was pulled through the <b>streets of Lilliput</b>, with all the <b>Lilliputians</b> lining up to watch.

<br><br>

It was a <b>carnival atmosphere</b> in which the Lilliputians seemed to be enjoying themselves, much to the amusement of Gulliver.

<br><br>

Finally, they arrived at the <b>Emperor’s palace</b>. The Emperor was there to receive Gulliver.

<br><br>

<b>"You are indeed a strange sight. If you are to stay here, you will have to be of service to my people,"</b> he said, pointing to the crowd.

<br><br>

Gulliver said, <b>"I agree to any condition, but only if you untie me."</b>

<br><br>

Gulliver was freed. He was provided with <b>food and water</b>, and a <b>house</b> was built for him. It was a <b>monumental effort</b> by the Lilliputians, who were all out to serve Gulliver.

<br><br>

Gulliver stayed with the Lilliputians, helping them with many small tasks.

<br><br>

It so happened that the neighboring kingdom of <b>Bleuse</b> was not on friendly terms with Lilliput.

<br><br>

The <b>King of Bleuse</b> declared <b>war</b> on Lilliput. He took <b>a hundred ships</b> to mount an attack.

<br><br>

The Lilliputians ran to Gulliver for help. The Emperor said, <b>"Don’t let us down now, Gulliver; we need your help."</b>

<br><br>

Gulliver walked into the sea. He took a <b>long rope</b>, tied all the <b>hundred ships together</b>, and dragged them in the water.

<br><br>

Gulliver pulled the ships the whole day, until the <b>army of Bleuse</b> was <b>giddy</b> and in no position to fight.

<br><br>

The <b>King of Bleuse</b> came begging for <b>peace</b> between the two kingdoms.

<br><br>

The Emperor agreed.

<br><br>

<b>Gulliver was hailed as a hero and lived in Lilliput for many years.</b>

Hello! Today, I am going to read a story called Alice in Wonderland.

<br><br>

Once upon a time, a little girl named <b>Alice</b> was sitting on a tree. Her <b>Aunty</b> was reading her a book when Alice slowly drifted off to sleep.

<br><br>

In her dream, Alice saw a <b>white rabbit</b> and started chasing it through a small <b>cave</b>. She crawled down further and suddenly <b>fell!</b> Luckily, her dress puffed up like a parachute, and she floated gently down.

<br><br>

She landed on a <b>chair</b> and sat down. Just then, a <b>book</b> floated past her. She grabbed it and began to read. But suddenly, she <b>slid off</b> the chair and sighed,
"Why does this always happen to me?"

<br><br>

Alice got up and continued chasing the rabbit. Soon, she reached a <b>small door</b>, but she was too big to fit through it. She turned the <b>knob</b>, and to her surprise, it squeaked,
"Ouch!"

<br><br>

"Oh! I’m so sorry," Alice said.

<br><br>

"If you want to go through, you need to drink the little bottle on the table," said the door.

<br><br>

Alice found the bottle and took a sip. Slowly, she began to <b>shrink!</b> Suddenly, <b>water appeared out of nowhere</b> and started rising. Before she knew it, Alice was floating in a <b>tiny bottle</b>, and the door <b>opened its mouth</b> to let her through.

<br><br>

The water carried Alice into <b>Wonderland</b>, where she saw animals up ahead.

<br><br>

"Excuse me, Mr. Bird," Alice called out, but the bird didn’t hear her.

<br><br>

Then she realized—she was <b>sitting on a toucan’s head!</b>

<br><br>

"Hello, little girl. Where are you off to?" the toucan asked.

<br><br>

"Have you seen a white rabbit?" Alice asked eagerly.

<br><br>

"Yes, he went that way," the toucan replied.

<br><br>

"Thank you!" said Alice.

<br><br>

"You’re welcome," said the toucan.

<br><br>

Alice continued through the <b>woods</b> but couldn’t find the rabbit. Feeling lost, she sat on a <b>log</b> and started to <b>cry</b>.

<br><br>

Suddenly, <b>two twins</b> popped up in front of her.

<br><br>

"Why are you crying?" asked <b>Beep</b>, the first twin.

<br><br>

Alice sniffled. "I can’t find the white rabbit. Have you seen him?"

<br><br>

Beep and his brother, <b>Bip</b>, nodded. "Yes, he went this way."

<br><br>

Alice hurried on and finally spotted the white rabbit. He was running very fast.

<br><br>

"Slow down, Mr. Rabbit!" she called.

<br><br>

"I can’t!" he shouted. "I’m running out of time! I’m late, I’m late, I’m late!"

<br><br>

He rushed through a <b>gate</b>, and Alice followed.

<br><br>

Inside, she saw a <b>Mad Hatter</b> and a <b>brown rabbit</b> having a tea party. They invited the white rabbit for tea, but he shook his head.

<br><br>

"No time! I’m late!" he cried and kept running.

<br><br>

Alice followed him to a <b>grand castle</b>. The white rabbit hurried inside to see the <b>Evil Queen</b>. She was <b>mad and shouting!</b>

<br><br>

Alice overheard the rabbit telling the queen, "You are the best queen! This is your land, and your soldiers are cards!"

<br><br>

The queen <b>challenged Alice</b> to a game of <b>mini-golf</b>. But the queen always <b>cheated</b> to win.

<br><br>

Suddenly—<b>Alice woke up!</b>

<br><br>

Her <b>Aunty</b> smiled and said, "Let’s go home."

<b>Rip Van Winkle</b> was a <b>lazy boy</b>. He was so <b>lazy</b> that he <b>slept the whole day</b>. His <b>mother</b> tried her best to get <b>Rip Van Winkle</b> to take up a <b>job</b>. When he did get a <b>job</b>, he was asked to <b>leave</b> because he <b>slept too much</b>.

<br><br>

One day, <b>Rip Van Winkle</b>, tired of his <b>mother</b> insisting on him getting a <b>job</b>, ran up a <b>mountain</b> with his favorite <b>companion</b>, his <b>dog</b> and his <b>gun</b>. He reached the <b>top</b>, crossed a <b>stream</b>, went to a <b>spot</b> where <b>nobody ever came</b>, and sat down <b>panting</b>. He had never had so much <b>exercise</b> in his <b>life</b>.

<br><br>

He was just getting back his <b>breath</b>, when he heard someone <b>call his name</b>.

<br><br>

*"Strange, nobody ever comes here and surely no one that I know,"* thought <b>Rip Van Winkle</b>.

<br><br>

He turned to see a <b>funny-looking man</b> carrying a <b>big barrel</b>. The <b>funny-looking man</b> said,

<br><br>

*"Please help me carry this barrel to my mates a little below the stream."*

<br><br>

<b>Rip Van Winkle</b> had climbed so far up the <b>mountain</b> to <b>avoid work</b>. Here was a <b>man</b> asking for <b>help</b>. He first decided to <b>refuse</b>, but then thought,

<br><br>

*"Let’s help the poor chap, then I can come and rest."*

<br><br>

So, he and the <b>funny-looking man</b> walked down to a <b>cave</b> in the <b>mountain</b>, below the <b>stream</b>.

<br><br>

There <b>Rip Van Winkle</b> saw many other <b>funny-looking men</b>, all of them were playing the game of <b>ninepins</b>. They ignored him.

<br><br>

As soon as the <b>barrel</b> was placed on the <b>ground</b>, the <b>men</b> pulled out <b>mugs</b>, dipped them into the <b>barrel</b>, and <b>drank</b>.

<br><br>

It was <b>wine</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Rip Van Winkle</b> also <b>dipped</b> a <b>mug</b> into the <b>barrel</b> and <b>drank</b>.

<br><br>

It <b>tasted good</b>.

<br><br>

He thought he should have <b>one more mug</b>, then another, and another, until he found the <b>room swinging</b> in front of him.

<br><br>

<b>Rip Van Winkle</b> went to <b>sleep</b>.

<br><br>

When he <b>awoke</b>, he saw that all the <b>funny-looking men</b> had <b>gone</b>.

<br><br>

He <b>called out</b> to his <b>dog</b>, but there was <b>no response</b>.

<br><br>

He <b>could not believe</b> he had <b>slept the whole day and night</b>.

<br><br>

He got up, his <b>joints ached</b>. He picked up his <b>gun</b>, but instead of the <b>clean well-oiled piece</b>, he found the <b>barrel rusted</b> and the <b>lock falling off</b>.

<br><br>

He <b>threw it away</b>.

<br><br>

As he <b>started trudging back home</b>, he saw the <b>village down below</b>, which seemed <b>somehow changed</b>.

<br><br>

When he <b>entered the village</b>, he saw <b>new faces</b>; all of them <b>looked at him</b> and <b>rubbed their chins</b>.

<br><br>

Seeing them do this, <b>Rip Van Winkle</b> did the <b>same</b>.

<br><br>

To his <b>astonishment</b>, he found he had grown a <b>foot-long beard overnight</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Rip Van Winkle</b> was <b>puzzled</b>; he believed that he knew most of the <b>village folks</b> well, but there did not seem to be <b>anyone he knew around</b>.

<br><br>

This was the <b>same village</b>, where he could see the <b>mountains</b> and the <b>streams</b>.

<br><br>

The <b>children</b> made <b>fun of him</b>, running behind him, pulling his <b>beard</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Rip Van Winkle</b> stopped by a place where there had been a <b>school</b> and asked the <b>crowd</b> that had gathered,

<br><br>

*"Where is Schooner, the schoolmaster?"*

<br><br>

Somebody said,

<br><br>

*"Oh! <b>Schooner</b>, he went to war in <b>sixty-three</b> and never came back."*

<br><br>

And <b>Van Dammel</b>?" asked <b>Rip Van Winkle</b>.

<br><br>

He died <b>eighteen years back</b>," said another <b>voice</b> in the <b>crowd</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Rip Van Winkle</b> thought he was <b>going mad</b>.

<br><br>

*"Had he slept all these years on the <b>mountain</b>?"*

<br><br>

Finally <b>Rip Van Winkle</b> asked,

<br><br>

*"Does anyone here remember <b>Rip Van Winkle</b>?"*

<br><br>

A <b>very old woman</b> said,

<br><br>

*"Yes, he was my <b>lazy son</b>. He went up the <b>mountains twenty-one years back</b> but never returned. His <b>dog</b> came back without him."*

<br><br>

<b>Rip Van Winkle</b> was <b>overjoyed</b>.

<br><br>

*"Mother, it is me <b>Rip Van Winkle</b>. Don’t you recognize me?"*

<br><br>

*"Oh! My <b>son</b>. It is really you. Where have you been all this while?"*

<br><br>

<b>Mother and son hugged each other</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Rip Van Winkle had indeed slept for twenty-one years</b>.

<b>Jim Hawkins</b> loved <b>adventure</b>. When a <b>blind man</b> by the name of <b>Black Dog</b> came to live with him and his <b>mother</b> in their <b>inn</b>, Jim had no idea he was about to embark on a great and dangerous adventure.

<br><br>

<b>Black Dog</b> was an <b>unfriendly old man</b>. One morning, he was found <b>dead</b> in his <b>room</b>. Jim and his <b>mother</b> opened his <b>trunk</b> and discovered an <b>old map</b>. It looked like a <b>treasure map</b>.

<br><br>

Jim was <b>excited</b> and told his <b>mother</b> that he would go in search of the <b>treasure</b>. But first, he went to meet the <b>village squire</b>.

<br><br>

*"Sir, this is what I found in the blind man's trunk. He died yesterday, and this looks like a map of hidden treasure,"* said <b>Jim</b> to the <b>squire</b>, pulling out the <b>map</b>.

<br><br>

*"Indeed, it does,"* agreed the <b>squire</b>. *"We should set sail immediately to find this treasure."*

<br><br>

<b>Treasure Island</b>

<br><br>

The next day, <b>Jim</b> and the <b>squire</b> boarded a <b>ship</b> and set sail to an <b>unknown island</b> in search of <b>treasure</b>.

<br><br>

It was a <b>long journey</b>. On the <b>ship</b>, Jim met a <b>one-legged sailor</b> who was the <b>ship’s cook</b>. His name was <b>Long John Silver</b>. He always had his <b>pet parrot</b> perched on his <b>shoulder</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Silver</b> was very <b>friendly</b> and had <b>Jim</b> laughing at his <b>stories</b>.

<br><br>

One <b>stormy night</b>, Jim, feeling <b>hungry</b>, walked up to one of the <b>barrels</b> that contained <b>apples</b>. Suddenly, he heard <b>voices</b>.

<br><br>

Jim felt <b>suspicious</b> and jumped inside the <b>barrel</b> to hide.

<br><br>

Once inside, he <b>froze</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Long John Silver</b> was talking.

<br><br>

*"Tomorrow we will reach <b>Treasure Island</b>. As soon as I give the signal, we will take all <b>passengers</b> on board as <b>prisoners</b>. Then we can take the <b>map</b> and dig up the <b>treasure</b>. Let us go back to our places before anyone sees."*

<br><br>

When <b>Jim</b> was sure they had left, he climbed out of the <b>barrel</b>. He immediately warned the <b>squire</b> about <b>Long John Silver’s plan</b>.

<br><br>

The next morning, the <b>island</b> was visible in the distance. Jim <b>jumped off the ship</b> and <b>swam to shore</b>.

<br><br>

There, he met a <b>ragged old man</b> who said, *"I am <b>Ben Gunn</b>. I have been <b>shipwrecked</b> on this <b>island</b> for <b>twenty years</b>. I suppose you have come looking for the <b>treasure</b>?"*

<br><br>

Jim <b>nodded</b> and said, *"I jumped off the ship because there are <b>dangerous men</b> on board. Please <b>help me</b>, my friend, the <b>squire</b>, is still on that <b>ship</b>."*

<br><br>

<b>Ben Gunn</b> knew the <b>island</b> very well.

<br><br>

He set up <b>traps</b> for <b>Long John Silver</b> and his <b>men</b>.

<br><br>

When they came <b>shouting</b> and <b>waving their guns</b>, they <b>fell into a hole</b> in the ground <b>dug by Ben Gunn</b>.

<br><br>

They were <b>trapped</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Jim</b> and <b>Ben Gunn</b> <b>unearthed the treasure</b> and <b>swam back to the ship</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Jim</b>, <b>Ben</b>, and the <b>squire</b> <b>sailed back home</b>, leaving <b>Long John Silver</b> and his <b>men</b> stranded on the <b>island</b> forever.

<b>In a club in England</b>, there was a <b>heated discussion</b>. <b>Phileas Fogg</b> had taken a <b>bet</b> with certain members of the club that he could <b>travel around the world in eighty days</b>.

<br><br>

*"Impossible,"* said <b>Joseph Cain</b>, one of the members. *"You cannot travel to every continent in eighty days."*

<br><br>

*"It’s a bet, gentlemen. Twenty thousand pounds,"* said <b>Phileas</b> confidently.

<br><br>

*"That is a bet,"* agreed the members.

<br><br>

<b>Phileas Fogg</b> had not made an <b>empty boast</b>. He was a very <b>precise gentleman</b> and had made <b>careful calculations</b> with a <b>world map</b>. He had decided that <b>eighty days</b> were enough to <b>travel around the world</b>.

<br><br>

His <b>bet</b> was <b>well-publicized</b> in all <b>newspapers</b> in and around <b>England</b>.

<br><br>

It so happened that a <b>major diamond burglary</b> had taken place a few days earlier. <b>Phileas’s face</b> matched the <b>description</b> of the wanted thief.

<br><br>

<b>Scotland Yard</b> appointed a man named <b>Fix</b> to follow <b>Phileas</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Phileas Fogg</b>, along with his <b>personal assistant, Passepartout</b>, packed their <b>bags</b> to start their <b>journey</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Phileas</b> had a <b>chart</b>. The first stop was from <b>London to Suez</b>—a <b>seven-day journey</b> by <b>rail and steamer</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Around the World in Eighty Days</b>

<br><br>

<b>Phileas Fogg</b> and <b>Passepartout</b> reached <b>Suez</b> and from there <b>set sail</b> to <b>Bombay</b> by <b>steamer</b>, a <b>thirteen-day journey</b>.

<br><br>

On this journey, <b>Fix</b> came face to face with <b>Fogg</b>.

<br><br>

*"Were you not on the steamer to Suez?"* asked <b>Fogg</b>.

<br><br>

*"Yes,"* replied <b>Fix</b> uneasily.

<br><br>

Upon reaching <b>Bombay</b>, <b>Phileas</b> and <b>Passepartout</b> checked into a <b>hotel</b>, with <b>Fix</b> right behind them.

<br><br>

In <b>Bombay</b>, <b>Phileas</b> learned that the <b>king</b> had <b>died</b> and the <b>queen</b> was to commit <b>Sati</b>, meaning she would <b>jump into the funeral pyre</b> of her husband.

<br><br>

<b>Phileas Fogg</b> was not a man to sit back and do nothing.

<br><br>

He and <b>Passepartout</b> went to <b>rescue the queen</b> on <b>elephant-back</b>.

<br><br>

They arrived just in time.

<br><br>

The <b>queen</b> had been <b>drugged</b> and was about to be thrown into the <b>fire</b> when <b>Phileas</b> intervened.

<br><br>

He carried the <b>queen</b> back to the <b>hotel</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Phileas</b> soon realized that the <b>queen</b> was very <b>beautiful</b>.

<br><br>

He <b>fell in love</b> with her and <b>proposed marriage</b>.

<br><br>

She <b>agreed</b>.

<br><br>

They were <b>married immediately</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Phileas Fogg</b> then told his <b>new bride</b> about his <b>bet</b>.

<br><br>

*"We must leave <b>Bombay</b> and travel to <b>Calcutta</b>, and from there on to <b>Hong Kong</b>—a <b>sixteen-day journey</b>."*

<br><br>

They reached <b>Hong Kong</b>, followed closely by <b>Fix</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Fogg</b> had noticed that <b>Fix</b> was always around, but he chose to <b>ignore him</b>.

<br><br>

From <b>Hong Kong</b>, they traveled to <b>Japan</b>, then to <b>San Francisco</b>—a <b>twenty-eight-day journey</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Fix</b> was <b>growing tired</b> of following <b>Phileas Fogg</b>.

<br><br>

Here was a man who never <b>rested</b>.

<br><br>

He had <b>found a bride, married her in a day, and kept moving</b>, jumping from <b>rail</b> to <b>road</b> to <b>sea</b>.

<br><br>

It was exhausting.

<br><br>

In <b>San Francisco</b>, <b>Phileas Fogg</b> once again saw <b>Fix</b> lurking behind him.

<br><br>

He waited until <b>Fix</b> was close and asked,

<br><br>

*"What is your game, sir? You have been following me from <b>London</b> to <b>Suez</b>, to <b>Bombay</b>, and now here."*

<br><br>

<b>Fix</b> was <b>speechless</b>.

<br><br>

*"I... I... It's just a coincidence,"* he stammered.

<br><br>

<b>Phileas Fogg</b> was now on his way to <b>New York</b>, then to his <b>final destination</b>: <b>London</b>—another <b>sixteen days</b>.

<br><br>

The journey to <b>New York</b> and <b>London</b> went <b>smoothly</b>, except for the <b>annoying presence</b> of <b>Fix</b>.

<br><br>

Everything was fine until <b>Phileas Fogg</b> realized he had not accounted for <b>different time zones</b>.

<br><br>

He was <b>shocked</b> to realize he would be <b>a day late</b>.

<br><br>

He had to <b>reach London</b> on the <b>morning of Sunday</b> to win his <b>bet</b>, but now, he would arrive on <b>Monday</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Phileas Fogg</b> walked home <b>dejected</b>.

<br><br>

He lay in bed when suddenly his <b>eye caught the calendar</b>.

<br><br>

He called <b>Passepartout</b>.

<br><br>

*"Did you change the calendar? What day is it today?"*

<br><br>

He had <b>told no one</b> about his <b>miscalculation</b>.

<br><br>

*"It is <b>Saturday</b>, Mr. Fogg. You have won the bet! I would have told you, but you seemed so dejected."*

<br><br>

<b>Phileas Fogg</b> <b>rejoiced</b>.

<br><br>

He ran to the <b>club</b> to tell the members that he had indeed <b>won</b>.

<br><br>

The members gladly paid <b>Phileas Fogg</b> his <b>twenty thousand pounds</b>.

<br><br>

As for <b>Fix</b>, he soon learned that the <b>real thief</b> had been caught the <b>very day</b> he had started following <b>Phileas Fogg</b>.

        In ancient Egypt, during the reign of <b>King Rhampsinitus</b>, a ruler known for his immense wealth, the king ordered the construction of a grand treasury to safeguard his riches. He summoned the most skilled architect in the land and commanded him to design a vault that would be impenetrable.

<br><br>

However, the architect, foreseeing an opportunity for his descendants, secretly built a hidden passage into the treasury, known only to him. Before his death, he revealed this secret to his two sons, <b>the brothers Ladronius</b>, who then decided to use it to rob the king’s treasure.

<br><br>

The Clever Thieves
Night after night, the brothers crept into the treasury through the secret passage and stole from the king’s wealth. <b>King Rhampsinitus</b> soon noticed that his treasures were vanishing but found no evidence of forced entry. Determined to catch the thief, he devised a plan—he set traps inside the vault.

<br><br>

One night, as the brothers entered the treasury, one of them was caught in the trap. Knowing he could not escape, he begged his brother to kill him rather than be captured and reveal their secret. Heartbroken but realizing the necessity, the surviving brother complied and severed his trapped sibling’s head, taking it with him to prevent recognition.

<br><br>

Outwitting the Guards
The next morning, <b>King Rhampsinitus</b> was astonished to find the thief\'s headless body in the treasury. He ordered the corpse to be hung outside the palace, hoping the thief’s family would attempt to recover it.

<br><br>

<b>Ladronius</b>, now alone, devised another cunning plan. Disguising himself as a drunk beggar, he approached the guards and engaged them in conversation. Offering them wine and laughter, he got them intoxicated. When they fell into a drunken sleep, he swiftly took down his brother’s body and carried it away.

<br><br>

The King’s Trap and the Ultimate Test
<b>King Rhampsinitus</b>, impressed yet furious, was determined to capture the thief. He ordered his daughter to hold a grand feast, instructing her to invite every man and ask each of them to confess the most wicked thing they had ever done. If anyone admitted to being the thief, she was to seize him.

<br><br>

<b>Ladronius</b>, however, was too clever. He attended the feast disguised once again, but when the princess tried to trap him, he placed a severed arm in her hands, escaping into the night.

<br><br>

A Thief Honored
<b>King Rhampsinitus</b>, recognizing that he had been outwitted at every turn, was filled with admiration rather than anger. Instead of continuing the chase, he made an unexpected decision—he declared that he would <b>pardon the thief and reward him for his brilliance</b>.

<br><br>

<b>Ladronius</b>, seeing the king’s sincerity, came forward and revealed himself. Instead of punishment, <b>Rhampsinitus</b> gave him his daughter in marriage, believing that such intelligence deserved to be honored rather than condemned.

<br><br>

Thus, the thief who had outsmarted a king became <b>a prince</b>, proving that wit and cunning were sometimes more valuable than wealth itself.

<br><br>

Moral of the Story
This tale, recorded by <b>Herodotus</b>, is one of the world’s earliest heist stories. It highlights themes of <b>intelligence, resourcefulness, and the power of cunning over brute force</b>. Rather than punishing the clever thief, <b>King Rhampsinitus</b> ultimately admired and rewarded him, recognizing his extraordinary wit.

<br><br>

        <item><![CDATA[<b>It happened once upon a time</b>, in the olden days, that a young man, <b>Periander of Corinth</b>, started from a port in the south of Greece to sail to <b>Miletus</b>. Being caught in a storm, the boat was carried out of her course as far as the island of <b>Lesbos</b>, where she stayed for several days, in order that the damage caused by the storm might be repaired.

<br><br>

In the meantime, Periander landed and occupied himself in wandering about the island and watching the inhabitants. In his wanderings, he came one evening upon a group of men and women, the sight of whom made him pause with a longing to join them. They had been working hard all day, gathering the grapes and pressing them in big, wooden vats to extract the wine for which Lesbos was famous; and now, in the beautiful autumn evening, they were making merry after their labors.

<br><br>

No wonder Periander stayed to watch them, for they made a very pretty picture—the handsome youths, with their bronzed faces and strong, fine limbs; the women with their gay dresses and bare feet, that seemed to have been made for dancing; the vine-clad hill at the back, and, over it all, the glow of the setting sun. In the center of the dancers sat a boy, playing upon a small <b>lute with seven strings</b>. To this accompaniment, the dancers chanted a song in praise of <b>Dionysus</b>, the god of the vine.

<br><br>

Gradually the music went faster and faster, and faster and faster the feet of the dancers sped over the ground, until they were all out of breath and lay laughing on the grass.

<br><br>

Then, as the boy struck another chord, all laughter was hushed, and he began to sing. It was a simple, plaintive little song, but there was a magic in his voice that held the listeners spellbound. The last rays of the setting sun played about his golden curls and lit up his sweet, childish face as he sang:

<br><br>

<b>Why should you grieve for me, my love,</b>
<b>When I am laid to rest?</b>
<b>Our lives are shaped by the gods above,</b>
<b>And they know best.</b>
<b>What though I stand on the farther shore,</b>
<b>Others have crossed the stream before—</b>
<b>Why weep in vain?</b>
<b>Life is but a drop in the deep,</b>
<b>Soon we wake from the last, lone sleep,</b>
<b>And meet again.</b>

<br><br>

As the last note died away, a sigh came from the listeners; some of the women turned away their faces, and the young men began to talk hastily, as if to hide their emotion.

<br><br>

Periander waited until the group began to break up. Then he stepped forward and laid his hand on the boy’s shoulder. The boy looked up with a smile.

<br><br>

<b>"What is your name, my fair minstrel?"</b> asked Periander.

<br><br>

<b>"My name is Arion,"</b> answered the boy, as if he were used to being questioned. <b>"I come from Methymna beyond the hills, where I used to tend the goats."</b> And he told Periander that his mother and father had died before he could remember, and that he was brought up by an old goat-herd, until a traveling minstrel, who happened one day to hear him singing on the hills, took charge of him and taught him to play the lute.

<br><br>

<b>"That was one of his own songs I was singing,"</b> said Arion. <b>"He always liked me to sing his songs; but, when I am a man, I shall make my own songs and sing them in the great cities over the sea."</b>

<br><br>

<b>"And so you shall,"</b> said Periander. <b>"Now, listen to me, Arion! Some day, perhaps, I also may be a great man, able to help you become a great singer. Remember, when you have need of a friend, that Periander of Corinth will help you, if he can!"</b>

<br><br>

And, when he departed, Periander left a sum of money with a worthy old couple, who promised to look after the boy and see that he wanted nothing.

<br><br>

[The story continues, including Arion’s adventures, his rise to fame, and the dramatic scene on the ship Nausicaa, leading to his miraculous rescue by a dolphin.]

<br><br>

<b>Life is but a drop in the deep,</b>
<b>Soon we wake from the last, lone sleep,</b>
<b>And meet again.</b>

<br><br>

<b>Arion leaped over the side of the vessel, just as he was.</b>

<br><br>

The captain, fearing that some of the crew might be moved to lend him assistance, gave the order to make all speed ahead. Had he waited, he might have seen the most wonderful sight.

<br><br>

For, as Arion fell into the sea, the water seemed to become alive beneath him, and he felt it lifting him up and carrying him rapidly away from the ship. Then he discovered that he was seated astride on a great, black fish, which was swimming very rapidly on the top of the water, and he knew it must be a <b>dolphin</b>, which had been attracted by his singing; for the dolphins, unlike most things that live in the sea, have sharp ears and are very fond of music.

<br><br>

A strange sight it must have been, had there been anyone there to see! But the dolphin went straight across the open sea, where no ships were to be seen. So it was that Arion came to <b>Tænarus in Greece</b>, without having been seen by any man.

<br><br>

From Tænarus, he made his way on foot to Corinth. <b>Periander was overjoyed</b> to see him once more; and when he marveled at the strange costume in which Arion had traveled, Arion related the whole story.

<br><br>

Periander listened attentively, and, when it was finished, remarked gravely, <b>"Are you then so little satisfied with your victories over the musicians, Arion, that you have determined to be king of story-tellers also?"</b>

<br><br>

<b>"Does your majesty intend to throw doubt on my story?"</b> asked Arion.

<br><br>

<b>"Far be it from me!"</b> answered Periander. <b>"The story pleases me well, and if you will tell me another such, I will take pains to believe that also."</b>

<br><br>

And lest any man should doubt the truth of the story in time to come, Arion erected at <b>Tænarus</b> a statue in bronze, representing a man riding on a dolphin’s back.]]></item>

        Arian was a boy who lived in a small fishing village by the sea. Ever since he was a child, he had felt a deep connection to the ocean. While other children played in the fields or helped their parents with chores, Arian would sit by the shore, watching the waves and wondering about the creatures that lived beneath.
<br><br>
One evening, as the sky turned shades of orange and pink, Arian heard a strange sound—like a cry for help—coming from the water. He rushed to the shore and saw a <b>dolphin</b> struggling near the rocks. Its tail was tangled in a thick <b>fishing net</b>, and the more it tried to free itself, the tighter the net became.
<br><br>
Without thinking twice, Arian ran into the water. The waves pushed against him, but he fought his way toward the dolphin. <b>“It’s okay,”</b> he whispered as he reached for the net. The dolphin’s dark eyes watched him, full of fear and pain. Arian carefully loosened the knots and untangled the dolphin’s tail. The moment it was free, the dolphin let out a joyful <b>click</b> and swam in a circle around Arian before disappearing into the deep blue sea.
<br><br>
That night, as Arian lay in bed, he wondered if he would ever see the dolphin again. He dreamed of swimming alongside it, exploring the mysteries of the ocean.
<br><br>
The next morning, he woke up early and went to the shore. He sat on the sand, listening to the gentle waves. Suddenly, he heard a <b>splash</b>. Looking up, he saw the same dolphin from the night before! But it wasn’t alone. A group of dolphins swam beside it, their sleek bodies gliding effortlessly through the water.
<br><br>
One of the dolphins approached Arian, holding something in its mouth—a large, <b>glowing pearl</b>. The dolphin gently placed it on the sand in front of him. As soon as Arian touched the pearl, he felt warmth spread through his hands. A tingling sensation ran up his arms, and suddenly, the world around him changed.
<br><br>
He could hear the dolphins—not just their clicks and whistles, but actual <b>words</b>.
<br><br>
<b>“You have a kind heart,”</b> said the dolphin he had saved. <b>“This pearl is a gift from the ocean. Whenever you hold it, you will understand the voices of the sea.”</b>
<br><br>
Arian was amazed. <b>“I can really hear you?”</b> he asked.
<br><br>
The dolphin nodded. <b>“Yes. And now, you can help protect the ocean.”</b>
<br><br>
From that day on, Arian used his gift to understand the creatures of the sea. He warned the fishermen in his village when danger threatened the waters, and he helped free other animals caught in nets. He became known as the <b>Guardian of the Ocean</b>, a boy who could hear the secrets of the sea.
<br><br>
And whenever he stood by the shore, the dolphins would always return, whispering their stories—stories only Arian could understand.

        <item><![CDATA[  A long time ago, there lived a <b>greedy king</b> named <b>Midas</b>. He was the ruler of a vast and wealthy kingdom, but despite his riches, he always wanted <b>more gold</b>. He spent his days counting his treasures and dreaming of becoming the <b>richest man in the world</b>.
<br><br>

<b>A Mysterious Visitor</b>
One day, while <b>King Midas</b> was admiring his collection of gold, a <b>mysterious stranger</b> appeared in his palace. The stranger had a magical presence and said, <b>"King Midas, you are known for your love of gold. I can grant you a wish. What do you desire the most?"</b>
<br><br>
Without thinking twice, <b>Midas</b> eagerly replied, <b>"I wish that everything I touch turns into gold!"</b>
<br><br>
The stranger smiled and said, <b>"Your wish is granted. From now on, whatever you touch will turn to gold."</b> With those words, the stranger disappeared.
<br><br>

<b>The Golden Touch</b>
Excited, <b>Midas</b> picked up a <b>small stone</b>, and instantly, it turned into <b>solid gold</b>. He touched a <b>chair</b>, a <b>table</b>, and even the <b>walls of his palace</b>—everything turned to <b>shining gold</b>.
<br><br>
King <b>Midas</b> was overjoyed. <b>"I will be the richest man in the world!"</b> he thought. He walked through his garden, touching <b>flowers and trees</b>, all of which turned into gold.
<br><br>

<b>A Shocking Realization</b>
Tired and hungry, <b>Midas</b> sat at his dining table and reached for a piece of <b>bread</b>. But the moment he touched it, the bread <b>turned into gold</b>. He tried to pick up a <b>grape</b>, but it also <b>turned to gold</b> before he could eat it.
<br><br>
<b>Midas</b> realized with horror that he could not <b>eat or drink</b>! He could not even enjoy the simplest pleasures of life. His heart began to sink.
<br><br>
Just then, his <b>beloved daughter</b> ran into the room. Seeing her father in distress, she hugged him. But the moment <b>Midas</b> touched her, she too <b>turned into a golden statue</b>!
<br><br>
<b>Midas</b> was devastated. <b>"What have I done?"</b> he cried. His greed had taken away the one thing he loved most—his <b>daughter</b>.
<br><br>

<b>Undoing the Curse</b>
Filled with regret, <b>Midas</b> fell to his knees and begged the gods, <b>"Please, take away this cursed gift! I do not want gold—I just want my daughter back!"</b>
<br><br>
The <b>mysterious stranger</b> appeared once again and said, <b>"Midas, you have learned your lesson. True wealth is not in gold but in love and happiness."</b>
<br><br>
The stranger told <b>Midas</b> to <b>wash his hands</b> in the river. <b>Midas</b> rushed to the river and dipped his hands into the water. As he returned home and touched his daughter, she <b>came back to life</b>! He hugged her tightly, grateful to have her back.
<br><br>

<b>The Lesson of the Golden Touch</b>
<b>Midas</b> had learned his lesson. He no longer cared for gold. Instead, he ruled wisely and shared his riches with his people.
<br><br>
From that day on, he understood that <b>true happiness is not found in wealth, but in love, family, and the simple joys of life</b>.
<br><br>
And so, <b>King Midas</b> and his <b>daughter</b> lived <b>happily ever after</b>.

        <item><![CDATA[  A long time ago in <b>Baghdad</b>, there lived a poor boy named <b>Aladdin</b>. He lived with his mother in a small hut and often dreamed of a better life.
<br><br>
One day, a rich and distinguished-looking man came to their house. He told Aladdin’s mother, <b>“I am a merchant from Arabia and I want your son to travel with me. I will reward him handsomely.”</b>
<br><br>
Aladdin’s mother, believing it was a great opportunity, instantly agreed. However, she did not know that this man was not a merchant but a <b>powerful magician</b> in disguise.
<br><br>

<b>The Cave of Wonders</b>
The next day, Aladdin packed his belongings and left with the ‘merchant.’ They traveled for many hours until they reached a <b>desolate</b> place with nothing in sight for miles.
<br><br>
The ‘merchant’ stopped, pulled out some <b>colored powder</b> from his pocket, and threw it on the ground. Instantly, thick <b>smoke</b> filled the air. When the smoke cleared, a <b>huge cave</b> appeared before them.
<br><br>
Turning to Aladdin, the ‘merchant’ said, <b>“Inside this cave, you will find more gold than you have ever seen. Take as much as you want. But most importantly, there is an old lamp—bring that back to me. Here, take this ring; it will help you.”</b>
<br><br>
Aladdin was suspicious, but he obeyed.
<br><br>
He climbed down into the cave and saw <b>gold, jewels, and sparkling diamonds</b> everywhere. He quickly filled his pockets. Then, in a dusty corner, he found an <b>old lamp</b>. Holding it tightly, he ran back to the cave’s opening.
<br><br>
<b>“I have your lamp! Please pull me out!”</b> he shouted.
<br><br>
The ‘merchant’ called back, <b>“First, give me the lamp!”</b>
<br><br>
Aladdin hesitated. He feared that once he handed over the lamp, the man might leave him trapped. <b>“First, pull me out!”</b> he insisted.
<br><br>
This angered the ‘merchant.’ With a loud cry, he threw another handful of <b>colored powder</b>, sealing the cave with a massive <b>boulder</b>.
<br><br>

<b>The Genie of the Lamp</b>
Aladdin was trapped. He sat in the darkness, feeling hopeless. <b>“That man was no merchant,”</b> he thought. <b>“He must have been a magician. But why was this lamp so important to him?”</b>
<br><br>
As he wondered, he absentmindedly rubbed the lamp. <b>At that very moment, a strange mist filled the cave, and from it emerged a towering figure!</b>
<br><br>
<b>“My master,”</b> the figure said, <b>“I am the Genie of the Lamp. You have freed me—what is your command?”</b>
<br><br>
Though afraid, Aladdin managed to say in a trembling voice, <b>“T-Take me home!”</b>
<br><br>
In an instant, Aladdin found himself back in his mother’s house. He hugged her tightly and told her everything.
<br><br>
Curious about the lamp, Aladdin summoned the genie again. This time, he was not afraid.
<br><br>
<b>“Genie, I want a palace instead of this small hut.”</b>
<br><br>
Before their eyes, a <b>magnificent palace</b> appeared! Aladdin and his mother were amazed.
<br><br>

<b>The Magician’s Revenge</b>
Over time, Aladdin became wealthy and powerful. He even <b>married the Sultan’s daughter</b>, the beautiful princess, and lived happily in his grand palace.
<br><br>
However, the <b>evil magician</b> learned of Aladdin’s success and plotted revenge. He disguised himself as a peddler, walking through the streets and calling out, <b>“New lamps for old! Exchange your old lamps for new!”</b>
<br><br>
Hearing this, the princess, unaware of the magic lamp’s importance, handed it to the disguised magician in exchange for a shiny new one.
<br><br>
As soon as the magician had the lamp, he rubbed it. The genie appeared and declared, <b>“Your wish is my command, Master.”</b>
<br><br>
<b>“Take Aladdin’s palace and the princess to the great desert, far away from here!”</b> ordered the magician.
<br><br>
In an instant, the palace vanished from its place.
<br><br>

<b>Aladdin’s Return</b>
When Aladdin returned home, he was <b>shocked</b> to find his palace and princess missing. He immediately understood that the magician was behind this.
<br><br>
But not all was lost—Aladdin still had the <b>magic ring</b> the magician had given him. Desperate, he rubbed it. Another genie appeared.
<br><br>
<b>“Take me to my princess!”</b> Aladdin commanded.
<br><br>
The genie obeyed, and in the blink of an eye, Aladdin found himself in the <b>great desert</b>, inside his palace. He saw the magician, and next to him, the magic lamp.
<br><br>
Before the magician could react, Aladdin <b>leapt forward, grabbed the lamp, and rubbed it</b>.
<br><br>
The genie appeared and said, <b>“My master, Aladdin! It is good to serve you again. What is your wish?”</b>
<br><br>
Aladdin replied, <b>“I want you to send this magician far away—so far that he can never harm anyone again!”</b>
<br><br>
With a <b>blinding flash</b>, the magician <b>vanished forever</b>.
<br><br>
The genie then carried Aladdin, the princess, and the palace <b>back to their homeland</b>.
<br><br>

<b>Happily Ever After</b>
From that day on, Aladdin used the genie’s power wisely. He ruled his land with <b>kindness and generosity</b>, ensuring that no one was ever <b>tricked</b> like he had once been.
<br><br>
The <b>genie remained</b> with Aladdin for the rest of his life, always ready to serve his true master.
<br><br>
And so, Aladdin and his princess lived <b>happily ever after</b>.

        <item><![CDATA[ Once upon a time, there lived an <b>unhappy young girl</b>. Unhappy she was, for her mother was dead, and her father had married another woman—a widow with two daughters. Her <b>stepmother</b> didn’t like her one little bit. <br/><br/>

All the nice things, kind thoughts, and loving touches were reserved for her own daughters. And not just the kindness and love, but also <b>dresses</b>, <b>shoes</b>, <b>shawls</b>, <b>delicious food</b>, <b>comfy beds</b>, and every home comfort. <br/><br/>

For the poor, unhappy girl, there was <b>nothing at all</b>. No dresses—only her stepsisters’ hand-me-downs. No lovely dishes—nothing but scraps. No comfort—only hard work all day. Only when evening came was she allowed to sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders. That’s how she got her nickname: <b>Cinderella</b>. <br/><br/>

Cinderella used to spend long hours talking to the cat. The cat would say, <br/><br/>

<b>Miaow</b>, which really meant, <b>“Cheer up! You have something neither of your stepsisters has—<i>beauty</i>.”</b> <br/><br/>

It was true. Even dressed in rags, with a dusty gray face from the cinders, Cinderella was a lovely girl. While her stepsisters, no matter how elegant their clothes, were clumsy, lumpy, and ugly. <br/><br/>

One day, beautiful new dresses arrived at the house. A grand <b>ball</b> was to be held at Court, and the stepsisters were getting ready. Cinderella didn’t even dare to ask, <b>“What about me?”</b> because she knew the answer would be: <br/><br/>

<b>“You? My dear girl, you’re staying home to wash the dishes, scrub the floors, and turn down the beds for your stepsisters.”</b> <br/><br/>

Cinderella sighed at the cat, <b>“Oh dear, I’m so unhappy!”</b> And the cat murmured, <b>“Miaow.”</b> <br/><br/>

Suddenly, something amazing happened. A bright light appeared in the kitchen, and a <b>fairy</b> appeared. <br/><br/>

<b>“Don’t be alarmed, Cinderella,”</b> said the fairy. <b>“The wind blew me your sighs. I know you want to go to the ball, and so you shall!”</b> <br/><br/>

<b>“But how can I go dressed in rags?”</b> Cinderella asked. <br/><br/>

The fairy smiled and, with a flick of her magic wand, Cinderella found herself wearing the most <b>beautiful dress</b> in the realm. <br/><br/>

<b>“Now, let’s get you a coach,”</b> said the fairy. <b>“Quick, bring me a pumpkin!”</b> <br/><br/>

Cinderella rushed to fetch one, while the fairy asked the cat to bring <b>seven mice</b>. <br/><br/>

With another flick of the magic wand, the pumpkin became a <b>sparkling coach</b>, six mice turned into <b>white horses</b>, and the seventh into a <b>coachman</b>. <br/><br/>

<b>“Now remember,”</b> warned the fairy, <b>“You must leave the ball by midnight. After that, the spell will break.”</b> <br/><br/>

When Cinderella entered the ballroom, everyone stopped in awe of her <b>elegance</b>, <b>beauty</b>, and <b>grace</b>. <br/><br/>

The <b>Prince</b> was enchanted by her and asked her to dance. They danced together all evening. <br/><br/>

<b>“Who are you, fair maiden?”</b> the Prince asked. <br/><br/>

<b>“What does it matter? You will never see me again,”</b> she replied. <br/><br/>

Suddenly, the clock struck <b>midnight</b>! Remembering the fairy’s warning, Cinderella fled the palace, losing a <b>glass slipper</b> on the steps. <br/><br/>

The Prince picked up the slipper and vowed, <b>“I will find her. I will marry the one whose foot fits this slipper!”</b> <br/><br/>

The slipper fit no one—until Cinderella tried it on. To everyone’s shock, it fit perfectly! Her stepmother protested, but the fairy appeared and transformed Cinderella back into her splendid attire. <br/><br/>

The Prince proposed, and Cinderella accepted. They lived <b>happily ever after</b>. And as for the cat, he just said, <b>“Miaow.”</b> <br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
No matter how difficult life may seem, kindness, patience, and staying true to yourself will eventually bring happiness and reward.   ]]></item>
        <item><![CDATA[  There was once a <b>woman</b> who wished very much to have a little <b>child</b>, but she could not fulfill her wish. At last, she went to a <b>witch</b> and said, "I would love to have a little child; can you tell me where I can find one?"

<br><br>
"Oh, that can be easily arranged," said the witch. "Here is a <b>barleycorn</b> of a different kind from those that grow in the farmer’s fields. Plant it in a flowerpot and see what happens."

<br><br>
The woman thanked the witch and gave her <b>twelve shillings</b>, the price of the barleycorn. She went home and planted it, and immediately, a large, handsome <b>flower</b> grew. It looked like a tulip but remained tightly closed.

<br><br>
"It is a beautiful flower," the woman said, kissing its red and golden leaves. As she did so, the flower opened, and inside, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a delicate and graceful little <b>maiden</b>. She was scarcely half as long as a thumb, so they named her <b>Thumbelina</b>, or <b>Tiny</b>, because she was so small.

<br><br>
A polished <b>walnut shell</b> served as her cradle, with a bed made of blue violet leaves and a <b>rose-leaf</b> for a blanket. At night, she slept in this cozy bed, and during the day, she played on a plate of water where a <b>tulip leaf</b> floated like a boat. She rowed herself from side to side with <b>two oars</b> made of white horsehair. Tiny could also <b>sing</b> so sweetly that no one had ever heard anything like her voice before.

<br><br>

One night, while she lay asleep, a large, <b>ugly toad</b> crept through a broken window, leaped onto the table, and said, "What a <b>beautiful wife</b> she would make for my son!" The toad grabbed the walnut shell with Tiny inside and hopped into the garden.
<br><br>
In a <b>swampy</b> part of a broad stream, the toad lived with her <b>uglier</b> son. When he saw the pretty maiden, all he could say was, "<b>Croak, croak, croak.</b>"
<br><br>
"Don't speak so loudly," said the mother toad. "She might wake up and run away, for she is as light as <b>swan’s down</b>. We shall place her on a <b>water lily leaf</b> so she cannot escape, while we prepare a home under the marsh."
<br><br>
They placed Tiny on a large green <b>lily pad</b> far out in the water. When she woke up in the morning and saw nothing but water around her, she wept bitterly.

<br><br>

The little <b>fishes</b> who swam beneath the leaf saw Tiny and felt sorry for her. "She must not stay with those ugly toads," they said. So they gnawed at the stem of the leaf until it broke free. The leaf floated down the stream, carrying Tiny far away.
<br><br>
As she sailed, little <b>birds</b> in the bushes saw her and sang, "What a lovely little creature!" A graceful <b>white butterfly</b> fluttered around her and finally landed on her leaf. Tiny was happy, for now, the toad could not reach her. She untied her <b>girdle</b>, fastened one end around the butterfly, and tied the other to the leaf, making it glide faster.
<br><br>
Just then, a large <b>cockchafer</b> flew by. Seeing Tiny, he grabbed her by the waist and flew into a <b>tree</b>. The leaf floated away, carrying the butterfly with it.
<br><br>
Tiny was frightened and especially sad for the butterfly, who would starve if he could not free himself. The cockchafer, however, paid no attention. He gave her <b>honey</b> and told her she was pretty—although, not like a cockchafer.
<br><br>
Soon, other cockchafers gathered and inspected her. "She has <b>only two legs</b>!" they cried. "She has <b>no feelers</b>! Her waist is too <b>slim</b>!"
<br><br>
"How <b>ugly</b>!" said all the lady cockchafers. The one who had captured her now believed them and let her go, leaving her on a <b>daisy</b>.
<br><br>
Tiny wept. She was the <b>loveliest</b> creature imaginable, yet even the cockchafers rejected her.

<br><br>

For the entire <b>summer</b>, Tiny lived alone in the great <b>forest</b>. She wove a bed from <b>blades of grass</b> and hung it beneath a <b>broad leaf</b> to protect herself from the rain. She drank <b>dew</b> and ate <b>nectar</b>.
<br><br>
But then <b>winter</b> came. The birds had flown away, the trees withered, and Tiny had no shelter. She shivered with cold, wrapping herself in a dry leaf. Snowflakes, as large as she was, fell upon her.
<br><br>
At last, she reached the <b>home</b> of a <b>field-mouse</b>. "Poor little creature," said the kind old mouse. "Come inside and warm yourself. If you clean my house and tell me stories, you may stay all winter."
<br><br>
Tiny was grateful and agreed. One day, the mouse said, "My <b>neighbor</b> visits soon. He is rich and wears a black <b>velvet coat</b>. If you marry him, you will never want for anything!"
<br><br>
But the <b>neighbor</b> was a <b>mole</b>, who despised the sun and lived in darkness. Tiny disliked him.
<br><br>
One day, Tiny found a <b>swallow</b>, half-dead in the mole’s tunnel. She secretly cared for him all winter. When spring came, the swallow invited Tiny to fly away with him, but she refused, not wanting to disappoint the field-mouse.

<br><br>

The field-mouse soon announced, "In <b>four weeks</b>, you shall marry the mole." Tiny <b>wept</b>. She would never see the bright sun again.
<br><br>
On the day of her wedding, she went outside to bid farewell to the sun. "Goodbye, bright sun!" she cried.
<br><br>
At that moment, she heard a familiar sound—"<b>Tweet, tweet!</b>"
<br><br>
It was the swallow! He had returned.
<br><br>
"Come with me," he said. "I will take you where the sun shines forever."
<br><br>
Tiny climbed onto his back, and they soared into the sky. They flew over mountains, forests, and rivers, reaching a land where it was always <b>summer</b>.

<br><br>

The swallow placed Tiny upon a <b>beautiful flower</b>. Inside, there stood a little <b>prince</b>, as small as Tiny. He was the <b>king</b> of the flowers. He placed a <b>gold crown</b> on her head and asked her to be his <b>queen</b>.
<br><br>
Tiny joyfully agreed. The flower fairies gifted her delicate <b>wings</b>, allowing her to fly. The swallow sang at her wedding, though his heart was heavy, for he loved Tiny too.
<br><br>
"You shall no longer be called <b>Tiny</b>," said the flower spirits. "Your new name shall be <b>Maia</b>."
<br><br>
The swallow bid her <b>farewell</b> and returned to Denmark. There, he sang outside the window of the writer who told this tale.

<br><br>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>
No matter how small you are, you are capable of great things. True happiness is found when you follow your heart, and kindness is always rewarded.

Many, many years ago, in a kingdom far, far away, there lived a beautiful <b>princess</b>. <br/><br/>
She had long, <b>red hair</b> and loved <b>roses</b> so much that everyone called her <b>Princess Rose</b>. <br/><br/>

Every evening after dusk, Princess Rose went out onto her <b>balcony</b> and clapped her hands. <br/><br/>
A <b>golden bird</b> appeared out of nowhere and perched on her shoulder. <br/><br/>
Instantly, the princess\'s hair began to <b>shine</b>, ablaze with a brilliant red glow. <br/><br/>

When the bird sang its enchanting melody, Princess Rose joined in, <br/><br/>
and the entire <b>kingdom</b> fell asleep, dreaming sweet dreams till the break of dawn. <br/><br/>

Thus, the years passed. Each night, Princess Rose and the golden bird sang their <b>lullaby</b>, <br/><br/>
filling the land with peace and pleasant dreams. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Witch\'s Curse</b>

<br/><br/>

But one day, something <b>terrible</b> happened. <br/><br/>
A <b>wicked witch</b> learned of Princess Rose and decided to curse her. <br/><br/>

"<b>Abracadabra, Sim-Sala-Bim, may the rose\'s color dim!</b>" the witch chanted. <br/><br/>

In an instant, Princess Rose\'s <b>hair</b> turned as black as <b>tar</b>. <br/><br/>

That evening, she still stepped onto her <b>balcony</b> and clapped her hands. <br/><br/>
The golden bird appeared, but this time, her hair glowed <b>black</b> instead of red. <br/><br/>
The bird sang its melody, and the princess sang her lullaby. <br/><br/>

Everyone in the kingdom fell asleep, <br/><br/>
but that night, they had only <b>nightmares</b> and restless dreams. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

The next day, the saddened princess asked the bird, <br/><br/>
"<b>Tell me, golden bird, how can I make my people\'s dreams sweet again till the break of dawn?</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>Black hair in rose water,</b>" the bird chirped in reply. <br/><br/>

Though puzzled, the princess followed its advice. <br/><br/>
She filled a basin with water and sprinkled <b>rose petals</b> over it. <br/><br/>
When she dipped her <b>black hair</b> into the rose water, it instantly turned red again. <br/><br/>

That evening, when the bird perched on her shoulder, <br/><br/>
the radiant red glow of her hair once more <b>lit up the night sky</b>. <br/><br/>
She sang her lullaby, and once again, the people had <b>sweet dreams</b>. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Witch\'s Revenge</b>

<br/><br/>

The wicked witch was furious that her curse had been broken. <br/><br/>
She decided to cast it again. <br/><br/>

"<b>Abracadabra, Sim-Sala-Bim, may the rose\'s color dim!</b>" <br/><br/>

Once again, the princess\'s hair turned <b>black as tar</b>. <br/><br/>
But this time, the witch also picked every single <b>rose</b> from the entire kingdom. <br/><br/>

"<b>Let\'s see how you\'ll break my curse now!</b>" she cackled. <br/><br/>

That night, the princess again asked, <br/><br/>
"<b>Tell me, golden bird, how can I make my people\'s dreams sweet again till the break of dawn?</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>Black hair in rose water,</b>" the bird repeated. <br/><br/>

"<b>But where can I find a rose?</b>" the princess cried. <br/><br/>

"<b>Black hair in rose water,</b>" the bird repeated and flew away. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Miracle of the Rose</b>

<br/><br/>

The princess was filled with sorrow. <br/><br/>
A single <b>tear</b> rolled down her cheek and fell to the ground. <br/><br/>

At that moment, a <b>young prince</b>, who had stopped beneath her balcony, <br/><br/>
reached into his pocket and pulled out a small <b>box</b>. <br/><br/>
Inside was a single strand of red hair. <br/><br/>

He bent down and placed the hair atop the princess\'s fallen <b>tear</b>. <br/><br/>

Suddenly, a <b>miracle</b> happened—the red hair transformed into a <b>red rose</b>! <br/><br/>

The prince picked the rose and brought it to Princess Rose. <br/><br/>
Seeing it, she quickly wiped away her tears, plucked its <b>petals</b>, and dropped them into the basin of water. <br/><br/>
Then, she dipped her <b>black hair</b> into the water, and the curse was <b>broken</b> once again! <br/><br/>

Gasps of astonishment filled the air. <br/><br/>
The <b>King</b> turned to the prince and asked, "<b>Young man, where did you find that red hair?</b>" <br/><br/>

The prince smiled and said, <br/><br/>
"<b>When the princess and I were children, I took a single strand of her hair as a token of my loyalty. <br/><br/>
And she did the same, keeping a strand of my hair.</b>" <br/><br/>

"<b>It\'s true, Father,</b>" the princess confirmed, taking out a small <b>box</b>. <br/><br/>
Inside was a strand of the prince\'s hair. <br/><br/>

The kingdom <b>rejoiced</b>. <br/><br/>
That very same day, Princess Rose and the prince were <b>married</b>. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>The Witch\'s Defeat</b>

<br/><br/>

When the wicked witch learned that her curse had been broken once more, <br/><br/>
her <b>rage</b> grew so intense that she <b>exploded</b> into a thousand tiny pieces. <br/><br/>

From that day forward, <b>roses bloomed</b> in every garden throughout the kingdom. <br/><br/>
And each evening, Princess Rose sang her <b>loving lullaby</b>, <br/><br/>
ensuring that all her people had sweet dreams till the break of dawn. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>Moral of the Story:</b>

<br/><br/>

True love and kindness can break even the darkest of curses. <br/><br/>
No matter how powerful evil may seem, goodness will always triumph in the end. <br/><br/>

 <b>Vikram</b> was the name of a <b>king</b>. He ruled over a city on the banks of the <b>Godavari River</b>. He was very famous for his <b>bravery and courage</b>. People loved him because he always <b>rendered justice</b>.
<br><br>

<b>The Sage and the Fruits</b>
One day, a <b>sage</b> came to the court of <b>Vikram</b> and gifted him a <b>fruit</b>. The king handed it over to his <b>treasurer</b>. Thereafter, the <b>sage</b> kept coming to the court <b>daily</b> to gift a <b>fruit</b> to the king. The king could not understand the reason behind this behavior. But still, he did not try to find out the <b>sage\'s intentions</b>.
<br><br>
However, one morning, <b>Vikram</b> noticed a <b>monkey</b> sitting on the palace wall and gave the <b>fruit</b> to it. The <b>monkey</b> had started eating the <b>fruit</b> when suddenly, a <b>dazzling gem</b> fell out of it. The <b>King</b> was very surprised. He immediately ordered his <b>treasurer</b> to get him <b>all the fruits</b> kept in the storage. The <b>fruits</b> had gone bad, but when the king had them <b>crushed</b>, each one of them yielded a <b>precious gem</b>.
<br><br>
The <b>generous King</b> donated all these <b>gems</b> to the <b>poor</b> and waited for the <b>sage’s visit</b> to the court.
<br><br>

<b>The Sage’s Request</b>
The next day, the <b>sage</b> visited the court of <b>Vikram</b> with yet another <b>fruit</b>.
<br><br>
<b>Vikram</b> welcomed the <b>sage</b> and asked him, <b>"Your Holiness! Can you please tell me why you have been giving me such precious gifts? Without a good reason, I cannot accept any gifts from you."</b>
<br><br>
The <b>sage</b> replied, <b>"I need the help of a brave man for a spiritual goal. Will you help me?"</b> <b>Vikram</b> readily agreed to this. So the <b>sage</b> said, <b>"O King, please come to the burial ground on the next moonless night. It is at a distance of 20 miles from here. I will wait for you under a banyan tree."</b> <b>Vikram</b> agreed to follow the instructions.
<br><br>

<b>The Moonless Night</b>
On the said night, <b>Vikram</b> covered his <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> with a <b>black cloth</b> and, unnoticed, reached the appointed <b>spot in the forest</b>. The <b>sage</b> was waiting for him and told him, <b>"King Vikram! To the south of this forest is an old tamarind tree on which hangs a corpse upside down. Please bring it to me."</b>
<br><br>
The <b>king</b> immediately followed the <b>sage’s orders</b> and reached the <b>tamarind tree</b>. On finding a <b>corpse</b> there, he <b>cut it loose</b>. As soon as the <b>corpse</b> fell to the ground, it <b>laughed loudly</b> with a <b>crackling sound</b>. The <b>king</b> realized that it was a <b>ghost</b>. But the <b>courageous king</b> carried the <b>body</b> over his <b>shoulders</b> and started towards his <b>capital</b>.
<br><br>
A short distance later, the <b>ghost</b> left <b>Vikram’s shoulders</b> and escaped to its <b>original spot</b>. The <b>king</b> climbed up the tree, brought down the <b>ghost</b>, and placing it on his <b>shoulders</b>, started walking again.
<br><br>
<b>"Who are you?"</b> he asked the <b>ghost</b>.
<br><br>
<b>"I am Betaal,"</b> replied the <b>ghost</b>, and in turn, asked <b>Vikram</b>, <b>"Why and where are you taking me away?"</b>
<br><br>
<b>"A sage has requested me to bring you to him,"</b> replied <b>Vikram</b>.
<br><br>

<b>Betaal’s Condition</b>
<b>Betaal</b> did not have any objection to going with <b>Vikram</b>, but he laid down a <b>condition</b>. <b>"We have to cover a long distance and to relieve the tedious walk, I will tell you a story. But you should not utter even one word till we reach the destination. If by chance you utter anything, I will fly back to the tamarind tree. Do you agree with this?"</b> asked <b>Betaal</b>.
<br><br>
<b>Vikram</b> agreed to this and silently listened to <b>Betaal’s story</b>.

        <item><![CDATA[   Carrying <b>Betaal</b> on his shoulders, <b>Vikram</b> started walking towards the <b>cremation ground</b>, while the narration of another <b>story</b> began.
<br><br>

<b>The Prince and the Riddle</b>
The <b>Prince of Kashi, Vajramukti</b>, and the <b>minister\'s son</b> were the <b>best of friends</b>. They used to be together all the time and <b>shared everything in life</b>.
<br><br>
Once, <b>Prince Vajramukti</b> and his <b>friend</b> went <b>hunting</b>. There, in a <b>garden</b>, the <b>Prince</b> saw a few <b>girls</b> playing <b>blindfold</b>. The girl who was <b>blindfolded</b> struck <b>Vajramukti</b> by mistake. As soon as she opened the <b>blindfold</b>, <b>Vajramukti</b> asked her:
<br><br>
<b>"What is your name? Where are you from? What is your father\'s name?"</b>
<br><br>
The girl gave him three <b>hints</b>:

She picked up a <b>lotus flower</b> and kept it on her <b>chest</b>, hinting at her <b>name</b>.
She took out her <b>earrings</b> and put them on her <b>ankle</b>, hinting at the <b>name of her town</b>.
Lastly, she made a sign of <b>plucking out teeth</b>, hinting at her <b>father\'s profession</b>.
<br><br>
The <b>Prince</b> did not understand the hints, but after returning, he told his <b>friend</b> about the incident. His <b>friend</b> solved the riddle immediately:
The <b>lotus flower</b> meant her name was <b>Padmavati</b>.
The <b>earrings on her ankle</b> meant she was from <b>Karnapur</b>.
The <b>plucking of teeth</b> meant that her <b>father was a dentist</b>.
<br><br>
<b>The Search for Padmavati</b>
<b>Vajramukti</b> and his <b>friend</b> went <b>in disguise</b> to search for <b>Padmavati</b> in <b>Karnapur</b>. There, they met an <b>old lady</b> who asked them to <b>stay at her place</b>.
<br><br>
When she asked them if they knew anybody in the town, <b>Vajramukti</b> said, <b>"I know Padmavati."</b> The <b>old lady</b> replied that she was <b>Padmavati\'s midwife</b> and had been appointed by her <b>father</b> to take care of her since <b>Padmavati\'s mother</b> had died when she was young.
<br><br>
The <b>old lady</b> then went to <b>Padmavati</b> and told her that the <b>Prince</b> she had met while playing <b>blindfold</b> had arrived and wanted to meet her.
<br><br>
However, <b>Padmavati</b> wanted the <b>Prince</b> to <b>solve another puzzle</b>. She applied <b>sandalwood paste</b> with <b>four fingers</b> on the <b>old lady\'s cheeks</b> and sent her back.
<br><br>
The <b>Prince</b> could not <b>solve the puzzle</b>, but his <b>friend</b> figured it out:

The <b>four fingers</b> meant <b>four days</b>.
The <b>sandalwood paste</b> symbolized <b>moonlight</b>.
This meant that <b>Padmavati would meet him after four days in the moonlight</b>.
<br><br>
<b>The Clever Plan</b>
After <b>four days</b>, the <b>Prince</b> went to meet <b>Padmavati</b>. His <b>friend</b> waited for him, but after <b>three days</b>, he did not return. The <b>friend</b> grew <b>impatient</b>.
<br><br>
Just then, he saw a few <b>guards</b> dragging a <b>lady</b> away. He asked the <b>old lady</b> why this was happening. She explained that the <b>law</b> in their town stated that any <b>girl suspected of loose character</b> was <b>thrown out</b>.
<br><br>
Later, the <b>friend</b> went to get back <b>Prince Vajramukti</b>. Just when they were about to leave, <b>Padmavati\'s father</b> declared that he could not <b>allow their marriage</b>, because the <b>King of their state</b> wanted to marry <b>Padmavati</b>. He could not refuse because the <b>King was arrogant</b>.
<br><br>
<b>Vajramukti</b> did not want to leave <b>Padmavati</b>, so his <b>friend</b> devised a <b>plan</b>.
<br><br>
At <b>night</b>, he <b>stole Padmavati\'s jewelry</b> and the next day, he went to <b>sell it</b>, disguised as a <b>Yogi</b>. The <b>King</b> recognized the <b>jewelry</b> and had him arrested.
<br><br>
When the <b>King</b> questioned him, the <b>friend</b> narrated a <b>fake story</b> that <b>Padmavati</b> had interrupted his <b>prayers</b> with her <b>beauty</b> and that she was of <b>loose character</b>. The <b>King</b>, following the <b>law</b>, ordered her to be <b>thrown out of the state</b>.
<br><br>
As soon as <b>Padmavati</b> was <b>banished</b>, <b>Prince Vajramukti</b> was <b>waiting for her</b> outside the state, and they both <b>met</b>. This way, she was <b>saved from marrying the King</b>.
<br><br>

<b>Betaal\'s Question</b>
After this, <b>Betaal</b> asked <b>Vikram</b> a question:
<b>"Who was at fault? The friend, Prince Vajramukti, or the King?"</b>
<br><br>
<b>Vikram</b> replied, <b>"It was the King who was at fault because whatever the Prince did was for love, and the friend did it for the Prince. However, the King did not even bother to learn the truth and punished the innocent Padmavati. A King should always justify his actions, and here, the King was wrong."</b>
<br><br>
<b>Betaal</b> liked <b>Vikram\'s intelligence</b>, but once again, as soon as <b>Vikram</b> opened his <b>mouth to speak</b>, <b>Betaal flew away</b>…

        <item><![CDATA[  <b>Vikram and Betaal: The Story of Somprabha and Her Suitors</b>

Bringing <b>Betaal</b> down onto his shoulders once again, <b>Vikram</b> started walking towards his <b>destination</b>.<br><br> As always, <b>Betaal</b> began narrating another <b>story</b>.

<b>The Kingdom of Ujjaini and the Fearsome Demon</b>

Long ago, the city of <b>Ujjaininagari</b> was ruled by a <b>demon</b>.<br><br> The people of <b>Ujjaini</b> lived in <b>fear</b>, always under <b>stress</b>, terrified of the demon’s wrath.

This story took place at the house of <b>Hariswami</b>, the <b>King’s messenger</b> and a <b>faithful officer</b>.<br><br> <b>Hariswami</b> had a <b>beautiful</b>, <b>intelligent</b>, and <b>talented daughter</b> named <b>Somprabha</b>.

<b>Somprabha</b> loved <b>dancing</b> and practiced at home every day.<br><br> However, her <b>brother</b> was often disturbed by the noise and <b>complained</b> to their father.<br><br> Instead of stopping her, <b>Hariswami</b> advised his son to study as <b>sincerely</b> as <b>Somprabha</b> practiced her <b>art</b>.<br><br> He was <b>proud</b> of his daughter, as she excelled in <b>drawing, music, and dance</b>.

However, he also <b>worried</b> about her <b>marriage</b>.<br><br> One day, he asked her:

<b>“What kind of a husband do you desire?”</b>

<b>Somprabha</b> replied:

<b>“I want a life partner who is learned, an artist, and a valorous man.”</b>

Unbeknownst to them, a <b>demon</b> was <b>listening outside the window</b>.<br><br> He roared:

<b>“I am the perfect groom for Somprabha! I will take her away one day!”</b>

Hearing this, <b>Somprabha’s parents were terrified</b>.

<b>Three Suitors for Somprabha</b>

A few days later, <b>Hariswami</b> had to travel to a <b>neighboring kingdom</b> to deliver <b>gifts</b> from his <b>King</b>.<br><br> As a royal <b>messenger</b>, he often <b>traveled</b> between states.

While on his journey, a group of <b>robbers</b> <b>attacked him</b>, trying to <b>steal the valuables</b>.<br><br> Suddenly, <b>Veersingh</b>, a brave warrior <b>hiding in a tree</b>, leaped down and <b>fought off the robbers</b>, saving <b>Hariswami and his treasures</b>.

Grateful, <b>Hariswami</b> offered his <b>daughter’s hand in marriage</b> to <b>Veersingh</b>.

Meanwhile, in <b>Ujjaini</b>, a <b>poet</b> named <b>Radhegovind</b>, the son of <b>Pandit Sudarshan Acharya</b>, arrived at <b>Hariswami’s house</b>.<br><br> He had written a <b>poem</b> inspired by <b>Somprabha’s beauty</b>.<br><br> When <b>Hariswami’s wife</b> opened the door, he immediately <b>requested to meet Somprabha</b>.

Delighted, <b>Somprabha’s mother</b> decided to meet his father to propose their <b>marriage</b>.

At the same time, <b>Somprabha’s brother</b> encountered an <b>artisan</b> who was constructing a <b>Biman (a flying chariot)</b>.<br><br> Curious, he asked about the <b>invention</b>, and the <b>artisan</b> invited him inside.

The <b>Biman lifted off the ground and soared through the air</b>.<br><br> Impressed, <b>Somprabha’s brother</b> declared:

<b>“You are a genius! You must marry my sister, Somprabha!”</b>

The <b>artisan agreed</b>, fixing the wedding date on <b>Akshaya Tritiya</b>.

Coincidentally, <b>Hariswami had also chosen the same day for Veersingh’s marriage</b>, and <b>Somprabha’s mother had selected Radhegovind as well</b>.

Now, there were <b>three suitors</b>—each family member had found a <b>groom for Somprabha</b>, believing <b>their choice was best</b>.

<b>The Demon’s Revenge</b>

However, <b>the demon</b> still desired <b>Somprabha</b>.<br><br> On the day of the <b>wedding</b>, as <b>Somprabha</b> was getting <b>ready</b>, the <b>demon appeared</b> and <b>abducted her</b>!

The family was <b>devastated</b>.<br><br> But the <b>artisan</b> reassured them:

<b>“I will bring my flying chariot. We can use it to search for Somprabha!”</b>

The <b>poet</b> and <b>Veersingh</b> also <b>joined</b> him.<br><br> The <b>poet</b> knew that <b>Veersingh was a strong warrior</b>, capable of <b>defeating</b> the demon.

Using the <b>Biman</b>, they <b>soared into the sky</b> and soon <b>spotted</b> the <b>demon</b> carrying <b>Somprabha</b> through the jungle.

Without hesitation, <b>Veersingh drew his bow</b> and <b>shot arrows</b> at the demon.<br><br> The arrows <b>pierced</b> through the <b>creature</b>, and after a fierce battle, <b>Veersingh killed the demon</b>.

They <b>rescued Somprabha</b> and <b>returned home</b>.

However, a new <b>problem</b> arose—each of the <b>three suitors</b> still wanted to <b>marry her</b>.

<b>Betaal’s Question</b>

After narrating the <b>story</b>, <b>Betaal</b> asked <b>Vikram</b>:

<b>“Who should Somprabha marry? Who is the most suitable groom for her?”</b>

Without hesitation, <b>Vikram answered</b>:

<b>“Somprabha should marry Veersingh.”</b>

<b>Betaal asked why</b>.

<b>Vikram explained</b>:

<b>“Writing poetry for your love is easy. Flying a chariot to reach your beloved is easy too. But a man should be brave enough to protect his wife and face any danger to save her. Veersingh fought and killed the demon to rescue Somprabha. He is the only one capable of protecting her and is, therefore, the right man for her.”</b>

Thus, <b>Somprabha married Veersingh</b>.

<b>Betaal</b> was <b>impressed</b> by Vikram’s <b>wisdom</b>, but once again, as soon as <b>Vikram spoke</b>, he <b>broke his silence</b>.<br><br>

As per their <b>condition</b>, <b>Betaal flew away once more</b>…  ]]></item>
